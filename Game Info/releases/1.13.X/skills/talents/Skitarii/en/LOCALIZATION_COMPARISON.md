# Skitarii: original game English comparison

[繁體中文](../LOCALIZATION_COMPARISON.md) | [Player descriptions](README.md) | [Technical index](SOURCE_INDEX.md)

- Original: local Steam Build 25606770, extracted 2026-10-02, UI resource. English and Traditional Chinese pair by the same description key/hash. Full text is stored under this release's `source/SteamBuild_25606770_1.13.1/`; that Build directory is Git-ignored.
- Mechanisms: Release 1.13.1 / `7e662fcda16219d775b84af50322be2e9cd9d62e`. Text and source both correspond to 1.13.1; actual in-game presentation remains unobserved.
- Read game English independently against previously verified evidence. Only explicit contradictions in effect direction, target, condition, quantity or unit count as English errata. Omitted mechanics and examples are supplementary.
- Placeholder displays are static reconstructions from the original template, existing verified values and necessary display mappings; they are not observed game screens. Export suffixes are metadata.

## Integrated Refraction Emitter

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_grenade_ability_force_field.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `1b8e6a78`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_grenade_ability_force_field_cooldown_desc / 1988edfa`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Field, explosions and charges | Shield absorbs incoming Ranged Damage; lasts 8s; activation/expiry electric explosions apply Electrocution within 5m; 3 charges, 75s cooldown; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_grenade_ability_force_field_cooldown_desc / 1988edfa` | Attached force field for 8s; cryptic_force_field_explosion radius 5, cryptic_discharge_shock; max 3, cost 75, regeneration 1/s [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_grenade_ability_force_field.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The English explicitly includes both explosions and their range, as well as the matching duration and charge/cooldown values. |
| Regeneration and effect boundaries | No shared regeneration progress, field keywords, alternative-cost status or upgrade details; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_grenade_ability_force_field_cooldown_desc / 1988edfa` | Shared progress gives 75 × 3 = 225s for full recovery; suppression_immune and count_as_dodge_vs_ranged; depleted alternative not enabled; absorbed-hit count serves separate upgrades [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_grenade_ability_force_field.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details supplement the original text. Preserve the existing cooldown assumptions and do not generalize Ranged protection to all Damage. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arc count and qualifying kill recharge | Arcs 4 times; each Elite or Specialist killed by the Arc Grenade generates 4% Capacitance; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_capacitance_gain_desc / 22344160` | Up to 4 initial targets; named grenade/jump/shock profiles restore 0.04 Combat Ability charges for an Elite/Specialist kill [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_grenade_ability_arc_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The count denotes initial arcs, not a promise of 4 hits or the number of subsequent jumps. The kill amount and enemy classes agree. |
| Priority wording | Prioritising Armoured and Specialist Enemies; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_capacitance_gain_desc / 22344160` | Four specific breeds are prioritised, followed by Elites and other valid targets; initial and chain selection use different elite-tag field names [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_grenade_ability_arc_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | Existing evidence does not resolve the full scope of the broad priority wording. Record this limit without researching another selection chain or declaring an English contradiction. |
| Damage structure, chains and resources | Massive damage and Impact; no exact damage, chain radius/limit, tick timing, capacity or recharge rule; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_capacitance_gain_desc / 22344160` | Explosion attack 0 / impact 50, jumps attack 0 / impact 10, ongoing shock attack 600 / impact 100; 12m, up to 5 jumps; 1.1s/0.2s; 3 uses, no natural 75s recharge [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_grenade_ability_arc_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Qualitative damage is not a fixed Health-loss claim. Preserve the existing 12 × 5 = 60 illustrative damage sum, 3 × 0.04 = 0.12 recharge, 50 × 4% = 2 points per kill and 6 points for 3 kills; Malfunction restrictions and timing are supplementary. |

## Artificer Servo-Skull

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_servo_skull_improved.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `a3e27be3`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_servo_skull_improved_clarified_desc / 4bb85179`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Companion orders and permanent base bonuses | Accompanied by a Servo-Skull; Double Tapping Tag orders shooting or data interrogation; Activated base Blitz bonuses now permanent; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_servo_skull_improved_clarified_desc / 4bb85179` | Improved main hacking skull has a permanent buff copied from the temporary base buff; shooting and interactable decoding orders use its control flow [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_servo_skull_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The companion, input, order types and permanent bonus behavior agree. |
| Numerical bonuses and order limits | No numerical bonuses, vulnerability/Burn stacking or target restrictions listed; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_servo_skull_improved_clarified_desc / 4bb85179` | Damage +25%; cooldown ×0.5; hit applies Damage taken +15% for 5s, one refreshing stack; Burn adds 1 up to 8 then resets duration; living/orderable skull and valid target required [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_servo_skull_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Retain 100 × 1.25 = 125 and 3 × 0.5 = 1.5s; the 3–3.25s base shooting range, unprovoked Daemonhost exclusion and decoding interaction condition supplement the wording. |


<a id="cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore"></a>

## Kinetic Repulsion

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `fc74e086`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore / e9096586`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Absorbed attacks and restoration amounts | While the force field is active, absorbed attacks generate 2.5% Capacitance, up to 75%; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore / e9096586` | Qualifying absorbed attacks restore 0.025 combat_ability charges; _capacitance_restored capped at 0.75 per field [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The rate and maximum agree; percentages are fractions of one Combat Ability charge. |
| Attack classification, resource and reset | No explicit ranged flag, damage-count basis, new-field reset or Blitz distinction; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore / e9096586` | ranged or count_as_ranged_attack; restore_ability_charge_percentage(combat_ability); maximum-resource cap; per-object reset; Voltaic Resistance tracks its output separately [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_force_field_capacitance_restore.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The details supplement the wording. Preserve 10 → 0.25 and 30 → 0.75, with 50-point charges yielding 1.25 per attack and 37.5 at the cap. |

## Noospheric Command

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_servo_skull_improved_tagging.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `dd8d8400`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_servo_skull_improved_tagging_fire_rate_cost_desc / 843cef80`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Attack order, duration and cost | Ordering an attack greatly increases Fire Rate for 2s; costs 30% Capacitance; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_servo_skull_improved_tagging_fire_rate_cost_desc / 843cef80` | Valid command applies cryptic_servo_skull_tagging_buff for 2s; cooldown ×0.15; full cost 0.3 combat_ability charges [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_servo_skull_improved_tagging.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger, duration and charge-fraction cost agree. The qualitative Fire Rate wording does not assert an exact percentage; the unused format value is +567%. |
| Threshold, refresh and stacking limits | No minimum resource, Psykhanium exception, existing-boost pricing or permanent multiplier listed; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_servo_skull_improved_tagging_fire_rate_cost_desc / 843cef80` | At least 0.3 charges in normal play; training_grounds bypass; valid living skull/enemy and following states; existing duration progress adjusts cost before resetting 2s; ×0.5 and ×0.15 multiply [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_servo_skull_improved_tagging.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Preserve 0.25 below threshold, 3 × 0.15 = 0.45s and 3 × 0.5 × 0.15 = 0.225s. Combat Ability Capacitance is separate from the Flamer/Medicae grenade uses. |

## Overcharged Arc Grenades

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_arc_grenades_brittleness.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `514f9bc7`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_brittleness_desc / 699afdc0`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Additional arcs and Brittleness | Arc Grenades create 2 more Arcs; enemies hit receive 8 stacks of 2.5% Brittleness; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_brittleness_desc / 699afdc0` | Initial max_targets = 4 + 2 = 6; chain node applies 8 rending_debuff stacks at 0.025 each [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_arc_grenades_brittleness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The arc count is initial targets, not extra chain jumps. The stack count and per-stack amount agree. |
| Duration, cap and damage calculation | No duration, refresh, stack cap or final-damage formula; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_brittleness_desc / 699afdc0` | 5s, timer restarts on added stacks, maximum 16; 8 stacks give 20% Rending, 16 give 40%; armour calculation differs from a direct final-damage multiplier [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_arc_grenades_brittleness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Preserve the armour-stage example with 100 damage, original multiplier 0.5 and Rending coefficient 1: 50 becomes 70 with 8 stacks and 90 with 16. Crossing armour multiplier 1 requires separate calculation. |


<a id="cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction"></a>

## Enhanced Arc Grenades

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `9658f591`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction_larger_desc / 6282ba9c`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weapon Malfunction and duration | Arc Grenades cause affected Ranged Enemies' ranged weapons to Malfunction for 12s; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction_larger_desc / 6282ba9c` | arc_grenade or arc_grenade_chain_jump_damage hits apply_weapon_malfunction; default and listed breed durations are 12s [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The effect and duration agree for supported targets; ranged weapons being unavailable does not promise that melee attacks stop. |
| Target support, refresh and damage-source limits | No living/component checks, refresh timing or ongoing-shock exclusion; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction_larger_desc / 6282ba9c` | Living target with Buff extension and weapon_malfunction component required; some breeds switch to melee; new qualifying hit resets t + 12; shock skip_on_hit_proc prevents repeated triggers [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_arc_grenades_weapon_malfunction.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Preserve expiry at 12s after a hit at 0s and 20s after a new hit at 8s. The 10m base radius, shock damage/tick limits and unsupported targets supplement the wording. |

## Overcharged Refraction Emitter

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_force_field_duration_increase.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `1736bea5`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_duration_increase_desc / edf9be63`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duration and extra midpoint Electrocution | Field duration 12s; Electrocute nearby enemies an additional time at the midpoint; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_duration_increase_desc / edf9be63` | 12s action replaces 8s action; extra explosion scheduled at t + total_time ×0.5 [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_force_field_duration_increase.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The configured duration and one added midpoint explosion agree; 12 ÷ 2 = 6s. |
| Timeline, interruption and unchanged radius | No full activation/finish timeline, early-interruption behavior or radius/damage increase; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_duration_increase_desc / edf9be63` | Full duration explodes at 0/6/12s with 5m radius; finishing at 4s still explodes on finish but skips the unreached midpoint; damage profile unchanged [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_force_field_duration_increase.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The additional timing and limits supplement the wording. Retain the earlier source record's lack of independent identical-Build/in-game confirmation. |

## Voltaic Resistance

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](cryptic_force_field_arcs.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `e1595ef8`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_arcs_desc / 143e5c50`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ending arcs and attack-count basis | When Refraction Emitter ends, shoot up to 4 Arcs in front based on absorbed attacks; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_arcs_desc / 143e5c50` | Field kill on expiry or ranged Health depletion; with living caster/talent, clamp(ceil(count / 6), 1, 4), selecting targets in front [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_force_field_arcs.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The ending condition, forward selection, maximum and count basis agree. |
| Minimum, thresholds and target/chain limits | No step size, zero-hit minimum, target radius or chain limit; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_force_field_arcs_desc / 143e5c50` | 0–6 →1, 7–12 →2, 13–18 →3, 19+ →4; zero still selects; living targetable enemies within 12m, dot >0.5; no valid target means no shot; 12m chain radius, up to 4 jumps [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_force_field_arcs.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The zero-absorption example, target conditions and chain limits are supplements. Count is ranged/flagged-ranged events, not damage amount; these arcs are separate from 5m field explosions. |

The percentage refers to Coherency rate, not maximum Toughness. |
| Rate, delay and recipient limits | No regeneration delay, deficit, personal modifiers or base-aura priority details; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_coherency_regen_aura_improved_desc / a053ecfc` | Same coherency_id as base, priority 1; base minimum 25%, improved 50%; delay/disable/weapon/movement/modifiers and maximum remain [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_coherency_regen_aura_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Preserve 10 × 50% = 5 points/s and 4s →20 with sufficient deficit and uninterrupted recovery; the text does not promise immediate or uncapped restoration. |

| Allied recipient scope | You and Allies in Coherency have +15% Ammo Reserve; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ammo_aura_toughness_desc / cc394399` | Server start_func iterates human_players and applies effect to each living player unit; player_spawned_func handles later joins; no Coherency/distance/chain check [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_ammo_aura.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Explicit contradiction | The English imposes a Coherency restriction absent from the accepted fixed-source recipient selection. This is a text/evidence mismatch, not an observed game result; the earlier Chinese verdict is not inherited. |
| Capacity adjustment and non-stacking | No flooring, current-reserve adjustment, late joins, removal or multiple-source limit; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ammo_aura_toughness_desc / cc394399` | Current/max reserve scale by 1.15 and floor; effects removed on ending; min_max_step_func 0,1 keeps a single 15% step across sources [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_ammo_aura.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Retain floor(101 ×1.15) =116, with 116.15 before flooring.

Unlike the earlier Chinese omission noted in its record, this English wording explicitly includes the caster in the aura recipients. |
| Cleave mass, armour stage and duplicate sources | No target-mass formula, final-damage formula or duplicate-source behavior; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_aura_weapon_improved_desc / 6d4feb19` | Cleave increases attack hit-mass budget; Rending modifies armour calculation; coherency_id cryptic_aura_weapon_improved, priority 2, no repeated application of same source [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_aura_weapon_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Preserve 10 ×1.15 =11.5 and the armour-only 100 ×0.5 =50 →100 ×(0.5+0.075) =57.5, with Rending coefficient 1 and a separate conversion when crossing multiplier 1. |

Powerful does not establish an exact Health damage value. |
| Active bonuses, charges and timing | No +30% Melee Damage, Stun immunity, charge settings, duration or charging limit; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_chordclaw_desc / df29b524` | Active melee_damage 0.3 and stun_immune; base 3 charges, cost 1/50 points, regeneration 1/s; maximum 10s and ends on weapon-slot switch; full charge 0.5s; talents alter attack pattern [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_chordclaw.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Preserve 100 ×(1+30%) =130 and with another same-stage 20% bonus, 100 ×(1+20%+30%) =150.

| Calculation and separate conditions | Does not explain the movement curve or the independent Spread condition; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_no_braced_movement_penalty_desc / f793a029` | Original 60% speed becomes `1 − 40% × 0.5 = 80%`; Spread 10 becomes `10 × (1 − 45%) = 5.5` without other bonuses. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_no_braced_movement_penalty.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The existing examples clarify the two effects without treating the movement change as a 1.5× speed multiplier. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windup protection and heavy damage | Uninterruptible while charging melee attacks; gain +15% Heavy Melee Damage; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_better_heavies_desc / 668011b5` | Windup enables `uninterruptible` and `stun_immune`; melee heavy profiles receive the always-supplied `melee_heavy_damage = 0.15`. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_better_heavies.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The two sentences distinguish windup protection from the heavy-attack damage stat. |
| Scope and calculation | Does not specify full-charge requirements, damage intake or other disabling actions; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_better_heavies_desc / 668011b5` | No `auto_completed_action` requirement for damage; protection is limited to windup. Damage still applies and nets/pounces are not covered. Base 100 with same-stage 25% becomes 140. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_better_heavies.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These are the existing condition, exception and calculation details; the English explicitly promises neither all-control immunity nor full-charge-only damage. |

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_hybrid_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated trigger direction, values and sequential decay match. |
| Separate timers and damage scope | Does not specify separate refresh timers or weapon switching; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_hybrid_damage_desc / dc9f61eb` | New stacks refresh the corresponding timer; switching weapons does not directly clear them. Five ranged stacks take shooting damage 100→115 even with five melee stacks. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_hybrid_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These existing details explain separate accumulation and prevent combining different attack-type bonuses. |

| Recovery fraction and duration | Taking damage restores 25% Toughness over 5s; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_toughness_on_damage_taken_desc / 655fac7c` | Positive Health damage to the player triggers 25% of maximum Toughness recovery over 5 seconds. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_toughness_on_damage_taken.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated fraction and recovery duration match the verified effect. |
| Cooldown claim | 10s Cooldown; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_toughness_on_damage_taken_desc / 655fac7c` | The template sets `cooldown = 10`; `ProcBuff` reads `cooldown_duration`, so that value is not used in cooldown checks. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_toughness_on_damage_taken.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Explicit contradiction | The English explicitly promises a cooldown absent from the accepted fixed-source implementation; same-build in-game confirmation remains outstanding. |
| Health-only trigger and refresh | Does not specify Health damage, percentage basis or retriggering; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_toughness_on_damage_taken_desc / 655fac7c` | Require self as attacked unit and `damage_amount > 0`; Toughness-only loss does not qualify. A new trigger resets the recovery budget and 5 seconds without stacking rate. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_toughness_on_damage_taken.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details explain the original 100-maximum example: 5 points/second and up to 35 through a retrigger at 2 seconds. |

| Trigger, speed, duration and cap | Successful Melee Attacks grants +2.5% Melee Attack Speed for 3s; stacking 5 times; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_melee_attacks_give_melee_attack_speed_desc / ff4edf3b` | A completed melee swing with `num_hit_units > 0` adds a 2.5% stack, maximum 5, duration 3 seconds. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_melee_attacks_give_melee_attack_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger and numerical effect match; the text specifies attacks rather than each hit target. |
| Per-swing count, refresh and action time | Does not explain multiple targets, refreshing or the speed-to-time formula; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_melee_attacks_give_melee_attack_speed_desc / ff4edf3b` | Multiple targets still grant one stack per swing; retriggering refreshes 3 seconds. Five stacks give 12.5%; a 1-second affected action becomes `1 ÷ 1.125 ≈ 0.889` seconds.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Critical melee hit and first target | Melee Critical hits Electrocute the first target hit; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_melee_crits_electrocute_first_desc / 3fc35e67` | `on_crit_melee` plus `on_first_target_melee_hit` applies Electrocution to the first qualifying target. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_melee_crits_electrocute_first.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Both the attack condition and target ordering match. |
| Target eligibility, duration and limits | Does not specify survival, duration, refresh, cooldown or resistances; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_melee_crits_electrocute_first_desc / 3fc35e67` | The target must survive and have a `buff_system`; `cryptic_electrocution_default` lasts 3 seconds with 1 stack and refresh. No extra trigger cooldown; enemy resistances still apply.

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_auto_reload.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The values and reserve source match; each second after the wait is compatible with the verified first-batch timing. |
| Rounding, eligibility and examples | Does not specify rounding, reload suppression, stowed-gun operation or transfer limits; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_auto_reload_desc / 612ee334` | `ceil(max_ammo_in_clip × 0.075)` is limited by missing ammo/reserves and disabled during manual reload; shooting resets the timer; operates on `slot_secondary`. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_auto_reload.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The original 2÷1.15≈1.74-second example and 30-round clip giving 3/2/1-round transfers explain the omitted calculations and exceptions; no ammo is created. |

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_ranged_vs_bfg.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The attack type, named categories and numerical bonus match. |
| Tag eligibility and addition | Does not specify breed tags or how damage bonuses combine; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ranged_vs_bfg_desc / 01397401` | `breed.tags` selects applicable bonuses, which add in the shared calculation. Against one category, 100→125, or 145 with existing same-stage 20%.

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_electrocution_applies_brittleness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The target, number of stacks and per-stack value match. |
| Events, cap, duration and armour calculation | Does not specify refresh events, cap, duration or damage calculation; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_electrocution_applies_brittleness_desc / 47a5f3d9` | Added/stack/refresh events qualify; Brittleness refreshes 5 seconds and caps at 16 stacks / 40%. Rending and Brittleness combine in armour penetration; teammates can benefit. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_electrocution_applies_brittleness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The original 3→6→9→12→15→16 sequence and 50→57.5 armour example, with all stated assumptions, explain omitted details rather than a flat total-damage increase. |

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_revive_speed_and_dr.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Reviving is a qualifying interaction, and both stated values match. |
| Other assistance types and calculation | Does not enumerate pulling up, net removal or rescue, or explain the calculations; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_revive_speed_and_dr_desc / 16a4ff53` | All four `valid_help_interactions` map to `revive_speed_modifier`; reduction requires `interactor:is_interacting`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger, stacks and recovery | Ranged kills grant stacks; each restores +1% Toughness per second; maximum 5; lasts 8s.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ranged_stacking_toughness_desc / 057bb0ce` | Each ranged kill grants a stack, capped at 5, with 0.01 recovery per stack per second and an 8-second duration. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_ranged_stacking_toughness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger and all displayed numbers match. |
| Recovery basis and refresh | The percentage basis, recovery cap and refresh behavior are not specified.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ranged_stacking_toughness_desc / 057bb0ce` | Recovery uses maximum Toughness and stops at that maximum. Another ranged kill resets the 8-second timer, including at the stack cap. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_ranged_stacking_toughness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details explain how the stated ongoing recovery and duration operate. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enemy category and range | “Specialists that get within …m of you are Marked”; 12.5m; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_specials_marking_desc / 5d780574` | Living enemies with breed.tags.special within outline_range = 12.5 receive an outline. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_specials_marking.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The range and target category match; “Marked” does not explicitly specify a different marking system. |
| Outline behavior and limits | No update interval, SmartTag interaction or team-wide visual behavior is specified.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_specials_marking_desc / 5d780574` | broker_proximity_target outlines update about every 0.25 seconds locally, disappear on death or leaving range, and provide no damage, charge or manual-marking reward. Other clients' presentation remains unobserved. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_specials_marking.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details qualify the broad marking term. The description makes no explicit team-sharing or SmartTag promise. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recipients, assistance and values | An incapacitated Ally in Coherency has Damage Resistance until freed; if you free them, they gain Stun Immunity and Damage Resistance for 6s; both +25%.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_disabled_allies_defense_post_boost_desc / 5bdd6b9d` | The requires_help Coherency effect uses 0.75. Assistance by self to a living ally grants a 6-second, 0.75 effect and stun_immune. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_disabled_allies_defense.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The recipient, conditional trigger, duration and reconstructed values match. |
| Boundaries and refresh | The exact help-state boundary, loss of Coherency, refresh and later Coherency independence are not specified.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_disabled_allies_defense_post_boost_desc / 5bdd6b9d` | Initial protection ends when the help state or Coherency effect ends. The later one-stack buff refreshes, provides ordinary hit Stun immunity, and does not require continued Coherency. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_disabled_allies_defense.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details distinguish the two effects without changing the stated assistance condition. |

| Damage type, injured recipient and cooldowns | “When you or an Ally … take … damage, they restore …”; Toughness damage → 25% Stamina, Health damage → 25% Toughness, each 15s.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ally_coherency_defenses_desc / 307b308a` | params.attacked_unit receives the recovery; the Coherency chain includes self. The two holder-side ProcBuffs use the corresponding positive damage component and separate 15-second cooldowns. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_ally_coherency_defenses.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The pronoun refers to the injured player, and the English explicitly includes the holder. |
| Resource bases and shared limits | The maximum-resource bases, lethal exclusion and cross-ally cooldown sharing are not specified.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_ally_coherency_defenses_desc / 307b308a` | The injured player's maximum resources determine recovery; they must be alive and not will_die. Each effect shares the holder's cooldown across eligible injured players.

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_strength_on_charge_gain.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger, term, value and duration match the verified power effect. |
| Full-charge threshold, refresh and power stage | The threshold, simultaneous multi-charge gain, refresh and final calculation are not specified.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_strength_on_charge_gain_desc / 9e3a3df6` | At least one full charge is required. Further qualifying gain refreshes one bonus; num_charges_gained does not multiply it. Power affects damage, Impact and Cleave through weapon/target-dependent calculations.

[Fixed source and line references](cryptic_toughness_replenishment_on_kill_bonus.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger, values and zero-charge condition match. |
| Recovery basis and combination | The description does not specify a maximum-Toughness basis or how recovery bonuses combine.; `ui / loc_talent_cryptic_toughness_replenishment_on_kill_bonus_desc / 583f2cab` | The bonus modifies existing melee-kill recovery, using class/weapon recovery and same-stage addition before total_replenish_multiplier. Only full charges count; recovery is capped at maximum. [Fixed source and line references](cryptic_toughness_replenishment_on_kill_bonus.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The English describes a replenishment bonus without explicitly asserting direct recovery of 25% or 50% of maximum Toughness. |

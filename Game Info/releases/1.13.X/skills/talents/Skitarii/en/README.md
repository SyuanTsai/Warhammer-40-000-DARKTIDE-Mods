### Integrated Refraction Emitter

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d45e19a1-d480-42db-bd0c-70ed43aba9aa" width="72" height="72" alt="Integrated Refraction Emitter talent icon">

- **Operation**: Select and activate the Refraction Emitter to deploy a shield around you that absorbs Ranged Attacks for 8 seconds. At activation and expiry, it electrocutes enemies within 5 metres.

- **Charges**: The base capacity is 3 uses, with each activation spending 1. Without other modifiers, each requires 75 seconds to recover; restoring all 3 after spending them takes 225 seconds.

### Purgator Servo-Skull

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295017d9-50cd-4797-8b33-bd3627a7139f" width="72" height="72" alt="Purgator Servo-Skull talent icon">

- **Operation**: Gain an additional Flamer Servo-Skull. After you designate a ground area, it moves there and fires for up to 15 seconds, with a 10-metre range.

- **Fire modes and cost**: Use Primary Action to switch between Dispersed and Focused modes. Each order to fire consumes 1 Blitz charge.

- **Example**: Base capacity is 3 charges. Selecting Medicae Servo-Skull as well adds 2, raising capacity to 5; fire and rescue share those 5 charges.

### Medicae Servo-Skull

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adeeeef3-0c2e-450a-974b-66ce6c6366bd" width="72" height="72" alt="Medicae Servo-Skull talent icon">

- **Operation**: Gain an additional Medicae Servo-Skull. Tag a Knocked Down, Hogtied or Netted teammate who needs assistance to send it to rescue them.

- **After rescue**: The rescue gets the ally back up. For the next 5 seconds, Toughness Damage taken is 25% of the original amount, and they restore 20% of maximum Toughness per second.

- **Example**: With maximum Toughness 100, the ally restores 20 per second during the recovery period, up to 100 total. Each rescue spends 1 Blitz charge, shared with the Flamer Servo-Skull.

- **Rescue limits**: It cannot rescue an ally hanging from a ledge. If rescue fails while you are still alive, the charge spent is refunded.

### Arc Grenades

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4875ee-4056-4964-ae36-846e598954bc" width="72" height="72" alt="Arc Grenades talent icon">

- **How it works**: The explosion has a 10m radius and sends arcs to up to 4 enemies, prioritising specific heavily armoured enemies before other Elites and valid targets. Each arc can chain to nearby enemies.
- **Chain range**: Each arc can chain up to 5 times within 12m; actual hits depend on valid enemies being nearby.
- **Electrocution damage**: The area explosion and arc jumps do not directly remove Health. Damage comes from ongoing Electrocution after the arc hits. Electrocution lasts about 1.1s and resolves once every 0.2s; damage per tick varies with enemy armour and other bonuses.
- **Damage example**: Suppose each Electrocution tick deals 12 damage to a particular target and this instance actually resolves 5 ticks: 12 × 5 = 60 damage. This illustrates addition; it does not mean every enemy always takes 60 damage.
- **Kill recharge**: When the Arc Grenade or its arcs kill an Elite or Specialist, each kill restores 0.04 charges of Capacitance.
- **Example**: Killing 3 qualifying enemies restores 3 × 0.04 = 0.12 charges of Capacitance. The grenade itself has at most 3 uses.
- **Capacitance example**: With 50 points per charge, each qualifying kill additionally restores 50 × 4% = 2 points; 3 kills give 6 points. This is the grenade's additional effect; the class's innate recharge on kills is separate.
- **Uses**: You can carry 3 grenades at base. They do not replenish themselves over time as the force field does.

### Artificer Servo-Skull

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0efafa0a-aad0-4bb8-869f-133db37cf152" width="72" height="72" alt="Artificer Servo-Skull talent icon">

- **How it works**: A Servo-Skull follows you. Double-tap the Tag input to order it to attack a valid enemy, or order it to decode an interactable data terminal.
- **How it works**: The base Servo-Skull bonuses become permanent: its shooting damage increases by 25%, and its shooting cooldown is halved.
- **Example**: Starting with 100 damage per shot and a 3s shooting cooldown, the permanent bonus gives 125 damage per shot and a 1.5s cooldown. When the skull hits an enemy, that enemy takes 15% more damage for 5s and gains 1 Burn stack. Burn reaches at most 8 stacks; at the cap, further hits reset its duration.

### Kinetic Repulsion

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb6e468-224f-4d7c-b696-cc58aa08f532" width="72" height="72" alt="Kinetic Repulsion talent icon">

- **How it works**: Each Ranged Attack absorbed by Integrated Refraction Emitter restores 0.025 charges of Capacitance, up to 0.75 charges per field.
- **Example**: Absorbing 10 Ranged Attacks restores 0.25 charges. At 30 attacks, the 0.75-charge cap is reached; further attacks do not increase the total.
- **How it works**: This restores Combat Ability Capacitance, without refilling force-field uses already spent.
- **Point example**: At 50 points per Capacitance charge, each absorbed attack restores 50 × 2.5% = 1.25 points; 30 attacks restore at most 50 × 75% = 37.5 points. Recovery is based on attack count, so a higher-damage attack does not restore more.

### Noospheric Command

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c365855a-e85f-4d0d-8156-4048ae9f7e02" width="72" height="72" alt="Noospheric Command talent icon">

- **How it works**: Tag a valid enemy and double-tap the Tag input to order the Servo-Skull to attack. For 2s after activation, its shooting cooldown is reduced to 15% of the original.
- **Example**: A 3s shooting cooldown becomes 0.45s. A full 2s boost costs 0.3 Capacitance charges (30% of one charge).
- **How it works**: You need at least 0.3 Capacitance charges before issuing the order. The Psykhanium does not check this threshold.
- **With Artificer Servo-Skull**: The permanent halving of the shooting interval multiplies with this effect. For example, a base 3s interval becomes 1.5s with the permanent bonus, then 3 × 0.5 × 0.15 = 0.225s during the command. This calculates the shooting interval; actual attacks still depend on aiming and target conditions.

### Overcharged Arc Grenades

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14c1a0d8-2916-40d7-a7e2-8572a0b3e6d2" width="72" height="72" alt="Overcharged Arc Grenades talent icon">

- **How it works**: Arc Grenades' initial arc limit increases from 4 to 6. The number of additional chain jumps per arc stays the same.
- **How it works**: An enemy hit by the arc chain receives 8 stacks of Brittleness, 2.5% each, lasting 5s.
- **Example**: One arc hit can apply 8 × 2.5% = 20% Brittleness. Another hit can continue stacking it, up to 16 stacks or 40%.
- **Damage example**: Comparing only the armour stage, assume 100 damage before armour, an original armour multiplier of 0.5 and a Rending coefficient of 1 for that armour. Eight Brittleness stacks raise damage from 100 × 0.5 = 50 to 100 × (0.5 + 20%) = 70. At 16 stacks it is 90. Crossing an armour multiplier of 1 requires a separate calculation.

### Enhanced Arc Grenades

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501bab77-4618-480e-80e8-3abb022f6a68" width="72" height="72" alt="Enhanced Arc Grenades talent icon">

- **How it works**: When an Arc Grenade explosion or its arc hits an applicable Ranged Enemy, that enemy's ranged weapon Malfunctions, normally for 12s.
- **Timing example**: A hit at 0s initially makes the Malfunction expire at 12s. Another hit at 8s changes expiry to 8 + 12 = 20s. Some enemies can still switch to melee attacks.
- **How it works**: Standard Arc Grenades have a 10m explosion radius. Whether a weapon Malfunction occurs also depends on the target supporting that state.
- **Ongoing Electrocution limit**: Subsequent repeated Electrocution does not trigger or extend the weapon Malfunction again. Another qualifying explosion or arc hit is required to restart the timer.

### Overcharged Refraction Emitter

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e70f3e4b-d2c2-4840-bc29-56ba85dd816d" width="72" height="72" alt="Overcharged Refraction Emitter talent icon">

- **How it works**: Integrated Refraction Emitter lasts 12s, 4s longer than the base 8s.
- **How it works**: The field causes an Electrocution explosion on activation, at the midpoint and on ending. During a normal full duration, the extra explosion occurs 6s after activation.
- **Example**: The midpoint of a 12s field is 12 ÷ 2 = 6s, so its three explosions occur around 0, 6 and 12s. Each still has a 5m radius.

### Voltaic Resistance

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba6e0fe8-b601-433e-a423-8a6b8ee7b79b" width="72" height="72" alt="Voltaic Resistance talent icon">

- **How it works**: When Integrated Refraction Emitter ends, it fires arcs based on absorbed Ranged Attacks: 0–6 attacks give 1 arc, 7–12 give 2, 13–18 give 3 and 19 or more reach the 4-arc maximum.
- **Example**: Even without absorbing any Ranged Attacks, the field still attempts to fire 1 arc at expiry. It hits a target only if a valid enemy is within 12m in front of you.
- **How it works**: Each arc can chain up to 4 times between nearby enemies; actual chaining still depends on valid targets being present.

### Resurgence

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7090c8fb-aaaa-4015-a5c1-21e7093507be" width="72" height="72" alt="Resurgence talent icon">

- **How it works**: Gain 25 Toughness. You and allies in Coherency retain at least 50% of the normal Coherency Toughness regeneration rate even when enemies are nearby.
- **Example**: At a normal Coherency regeneration rate of 10 points/s, the minimum combat rate for you and allies is 10 × 50% = 5 points/s. With uninterrupted regeneration and sufficient deficit, 4s restores 20 points, subject to the Toughness deficit and personal regeneration modifiers.
- **Regeneration conditions**: The Toughness regeneration delay after taking damage must still finish, and normal Coherency regeneration must remain available. This effect does not cancel the delay or let Toughness exceed its maximum.

### Ammunition Deposit

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59dcc637-0b0f-4f3b-8e79-f4fdf53b6cef" width="72" height="72" alt="Ammunition Deposit talent icon">

- **How it works**: Gain 25 Toughness and increase Ammo Reserve capacity by 15%.
- **Example**: A maximum reserve of 101 rounds becomes 101 × 1.15 = 116.15, rounded down to 116 rounds. Current reserve also adjusts when capacity changes.
- **Recipients**: The Ammo Reserve bonus applies to you and player-controlled allies in the mission, without requiring Coherency range. If multiple allies select this talent, the capacity bonus remains 15%.

### Foe-Render Creed

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a48f1d74-488a-42d3-a59d-33d55135dad2" width="72" height="72" alt="Foe-Render Creed talent icon">

- **How it works**: Your maximum Toughness increases by 25. You and allies in Coherency gain 15% Cleave and 7.5% Rending.
- **Cleave example**: If an attack originally penetrates a total target mass of 10, the bonus raises it to 10 × 1.15 = 11.5. The number of additional enemies actually hit depends on enemy mass and weapon limits.
- **Rending example**: Comparing only the armour stage, assume 100 damage before armour, an original armour multiplier of 0.5 and a Rending coefficient of 1 for this armour type. Damage changes from 100 × 0.5 = 50 to 100 × (0.5 + 0.075) = 57.5. Crossing an armour multiplier of 1 uses a different conversion; this is not a direct 7.5% damage increase on every hit.

### Chordclaw Strike

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7ec3de-6e36-4171-8be2-d385177b170e" width="72" height="72" alt="Chordclaw Strike talent icon">

- **How it works**: Activating Chordclaw Strike costs 1 charge of Capacitance. The base capacity is 3 charges, which other talents can increase. The Chordclaw Heavy Attack is a guaranteed Critical Strike and has 50% more Rending.
- **How it works**: The active Chordclaw effect also increases Melee Damage by 30% and grants Stun immunity. Rending affects damage calculations against protection; a guaranteed Critical Strike does not mean fixed Health damage against every enemy.
- **Damage example**: Considering only the 30% melee bonus, with armour, Critical Strike and other conditions held fixed, 100 damage becomes 100 × (1 + 30%) = 130. With another 20% bonus already in the same stage, it is 100 × (1 + 20% + 30%) = 150. Rending and Critical Strike effects are calculated separately for the target.
- **Charges and duration**: Each use consumes one 50-point Capacitance charge, taking 50s to restore without other recovery bonuses. The attack effect lasts at most 10s and ends when switching away from the Chordclaw. Repeated activations consume charges but do not retrigger ability effects that depend on the initial activation.

### Restoration Protocol

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb879996-8768-4102-8799-0fecaf6f7a98" width="72" height="72" alt="Restoration Protocol talent icon">

- **Activation effect**: Activating Advanced Combat Doctrines immediately clears your Suppression. This clear does not grant Suppression immunity for the rest of the stance.
- **Recovery**: While the stance remains active, it restores 10% of maximum Toughness per second until the stance ends. Recovery modifiers and the Toughness maximum still apply.
- **Recovery example**: With 150 maximum Toughness and no other recovery bonuses, it restores 150 × 10% = 15 points/s, or 60 points over 4s.

#### Traditional Chinese text correction

- The Traditional Chinese description adds a Toughness-point unit after the `{toughness}` placeholder, even though this field is a percentage. The correct effect restores 10% of maximum Toughness per second: with 150 maximum Toughness, that is 15 points/s, rather than a fixed 10 points. The original English does not add a point unit; this correction concerns the Traditional Chinese wording.

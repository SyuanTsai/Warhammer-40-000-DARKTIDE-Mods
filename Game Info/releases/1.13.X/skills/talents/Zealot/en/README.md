### Immolation Grenade

- **Operation**: Carry up to **3**; the fuse is **1.7 seconds**. Detonation first deals explosion damage, then leaves a flaming area lasting **15 seconds**.
- **Ongoing damage**: Enemies inside take Burn damage approximately every **0.5–1.25 seconds**. Each instance is randomly **50%–150%** of that difficulty's baseline. Leaving the fire also applies **1 second** of lingering Burn.
- **Damage example**: With an Unarmoured baseline of **100** for one Burn instance, and no other increases or reductions, a 50% roll deals `100 × 0.5 = 50`; a 150% roll deals `100 × 1.5 = 150`. Under the same conditions, Flak baseline damage is **75**, and Carapace **5**.
- **Calculation limits**: Initial explosion, Burn while standing in the fire, and lingering Burn after leaving are calculated separately. Both damage and intervals vary; these single-instance numbers are not damage per second.

#### Traditional Chinese localization note

- The Chinese description renders English **“Burning and Staggering”** as burning and stunning. Here it should describe **Stagger**, not **Stun**; the terms must remain distinct.

### Blades of Faith

- **Operation**: Replace grenades with up to **12 throwing knives**, throwable while sprinting. Ordinary grenade pickups cannot replenish knives.
- **Damage and armour**: On an ordinary hit without other modifiers, baseline damage to an Unarmoured hit zone is **585**; Flak gives `585 × 0.8 = 468`, and Carapace ordinary-hit baseline is **0**. Weakspots, Critical Hits, Rending and enemy hit zones change the result; zero here does not mean heavily armoured enemies cannot be damaged under any circumstances.
- **Melee replenishment**: Your melee kill of an Elite or Specialist restores **1 knife**, up to 12. Starting with 11, a qualifying kill gives `11 + 1 = 12`.
- **Ammo example**: Without extra replenishment multipliers, a small Ammo pickup restores `12 × 15% = 1.8`, rounded up to **2** knives; a large pickup restores `12 × 50% = 6`; a deployed Ammo Crate can refill to maximum. Mission Ammo replenishment multipliers affect these amounts; the final count remains capped at **12**.
- **Throw timing**: The standard action launches the knife **0.25 seconds** after starting and lasts **0.55 seconds** in total. This excludes flight time.

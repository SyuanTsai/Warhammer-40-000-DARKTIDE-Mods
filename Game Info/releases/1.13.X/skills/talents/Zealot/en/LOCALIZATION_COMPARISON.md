|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flaming liquid and Burn | Leaves flaming liquid, Burning enemies.; `ui / loc_talent_ability_fire_grenade_desc / 5b720fa5` | The projectile creates a fire liquid area with an ongoing burning buff. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_flame_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The central ground-fire and Burn effect agrees. |
| Control and relative armour effectiveness | Staggering enemies, barring their path; most effective against Unarmoured Enemies.; `ui / loc_talent_ability_fire_grenade_desc / 5b720fa5` | Existing evidence supplies a fire navigation cost of 5 and differing armour multipliers; unconditional enemy stopping and comparative in-game armour performance remain unobserved. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_flame_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | Keep the accepted qualitative-control and armour-test limits; no explicit numerical contradiction is established. |

[Fixed source and line references](zealot_improved_stun_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The named base grenade and explicit percentage match the static reconstruction. |
| All-enemy control claim | Stuns all Enemies within its blast radius.; `ui / loc_zealot_improved_stun_grenade_desc / 35fbc631` | Accepted documentation retains target checks, distance/obstruction limits and resistance-dependent sustained control; every enemy's actual response remains unobserved. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_improved_stun_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | The existing evidence does not establish the universal control claim; no new mechanism investigation is required. |
| Charges, timing and periodic damage exception | No capacity, fuse, Electrocution duration, refresh, interval or damage exception specified.; `ui / loc_zealot_improved_stun_grenade_desc / 35fbc631` | Capacity 3, fuse 1.5s, one refreshing 8s Electrocution effect at 0.3–0.8s intervals; isolated damage 4/8; excludes periodic damage on an already staggered Poxwalker Bomber. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_improved_stun_grenade.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details supplement the radius/control wording; the exception does not imply complete grenade immunity. |

[Fixed source and line references](zealot_toughness_damage_reduction_coherency_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The named recipients, damage type and 15% reduction agree. The English does not promise direct Health reduction or additive base-Aura stacking. |
| Priority, duplicates and recipient exception | No priority, duplicate-source rule, recipient keyword exception or independent-modifier calculation specified.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_toughness_aura_efficiency_desc / 90d53110` | One winning Aura per coherency_id; improved priority 1 precedes base 2; max_stacks 1; prevent_coherency_buffs_from_other_players limits outside-player sources.

[Fixed source and line references](zealot_stamina_cost_multiplier_aura.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The signed percentage and explicit Delay Reduction express the accepted direction and units. |
| Duplicates, pause and display metadata | No duplicate-source rule, recipient exception, recovery-pause condition or Tactical Overlay lookup listed.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_stamina_cost_multiplier_delay_aura_description / 2b5c13bc` | One selected Aura; max_stacks1; recipient keyword restricts others' sources; paused regeneration may block recovery; related_talents may produce a Benediction display mismatch.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Per-pulse recovery | Each pulse Replenishes 45% Toughness to Allies in Coherency.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_bolstering_prayer_expanded_description / ae04279a` | Each pulse restores 20%; fixed updates separately restore 25%/second, including an initial-frame adjustment. The format sum is 0.20 + 0.25. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_bolstering_prayer.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Explicit contradiction | The English assigns the sum to each pulse, contradicting the accepted separation of a pulse amount from a per-second rate. Static reconstruction is not an observed game screen. |
| Pulse interval, maximum bonus and cooldown | Pulses every 0.8s; each adds +15 Max Toughness, up to +75 for10s; 60s Base Cooldown.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_bolstering_prayer_expanded_description / ae04279a` | Interval0.8s; +15 per stack/max5, duration10s refreshing; base resource cooldown60s. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_bolstering_prayer.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | These explicit values agree. The English does not specify the post-relic start of cooldown recovery. |
| Recipients, protection and execution limits | Allies in Coherency have Stun Immunity and Unkillable while channeling; detailed execution conditions omitted.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_bolstering_prayer_expanded_description / ae04279a` | Self is also in the chain; protection refreshes1.5s per pulse; full action≈3.67s/5 ticks; susceptible targets, line-of-sight and range rules; recovery capped/modified and cooldown paused while relic held.

Name and missing description: [source evidence](zealot_channel_grants_toughness_damage_reduction.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `6a8b51aa`. Every row uses `ui / candidate key loc_talent_zealot_zealot_channel_defensive_desc  / no exact hash`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exact description pairing | Exact description unavailable; candidate key contains duplicate zealot and a trailing space.; `ui / candidate key loc_talent_zealot_zealot_channel_defensive_desc  / no exact hash` | Accepted special rule, pulse application and stepped Buff confirm 8% per stack, max5, duration10s for self and Coherency allies. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_channel_grants_toughness_damage_reduction.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | The absence of an exact description match prevents semantic comparison or reconstruction; no similar-key replacement is made. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pulse amount, stacks, duration and recipients | Each pulse grants +6% Damage to you and Allies in Coherency; stacks 5 times; lasts 10s.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_zealot_channel_offensive_desc / af1e14c2` | Each tick adds one damage stat stack of 0.06 to self and Coherency allies; max 5, duration 10s. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_channel_grants_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The English uses the correct stacks placeholder and agrees on recipients and quantities. |
| Refresh, interruption and damage calculation | No duration refresh, early-interruption limit or additive damage-stage calculation specified.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_zealot_channel_offensive_desc / af1e14c2` | Further pulses refresh the stacked Buff; full channel gives about 5 pulses; damage is a global stat with same-stage addition and weapon-dependent calculations. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_channel_grants_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Retain 100→130 and existing same-stage 25%→155; these are supplements rather than repeated English errors. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Charge limit | “now has {charges:%s} charges” → 2; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_dash_has_more_charges_desc / 13ade9bb` | `PlayerAbilities.zealot_targeted_dash_improved_double` sets `max_charges=2`. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_additional_charge_of_ability.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The named ability and charge count match. |
| Recharge details | The template specifies a count but no recharge schedule.; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_dash_has_more_charges_desc / 13ade9bb` | One resource pool recharges at 1 resource/s; each charge costs 30. Two empty charges take about 30/60 seconds for one/both under the stated assumptions. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_additional_charge_of_ability.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Shared recharge, the cap, and interactions supplement the count without contradicting it. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duration, cooldown and bonuses | 3s Stealth; +20% Movement Speed, +150% Backstab/Finesse, +100% Critical Chance/Melee Rending; cooldown 30s; `ui / loc_ability_zealot_stealth_rending_description / 644f101d` | Base Buff and ability values match; `critical_strike_chance=1` adds 100 percentage points. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_stealth.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The reconstructed numbers agree with the accepted values. |
| Exit filters and damage stages | “Attacking makes you leave Stealth”; no detailed filters or component formula; `ui / loc_ability_zealot_stealth_rending_description / 644f101d` | Own-event and damage/action filters, 0.5s non-damage grace, assistance events and separate damage stages qualify the behavior. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_stealth.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The omissions supplement the ordinary behavior; the Finesse examples do not imply +150% to the whole hit. |

| Extension and signed post-Stealth bonuses | Duration +2s; “gain -75% Threat and 50% Backstab Damage for 5s”; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_stealth_duration_threat_damage_desc / f25397d4` | Stealth totals 5s; post-Stealth `threat_weight_multiplier=0.25`, `backstab_damage=0.5`, duration 5s. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_increased_duration.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Reading the negative sign with “gain” gives the correct direction. The separate Chinese wording issue does not establish an English erratum. |
| Threat, refresh and damage interpretation | No target-selection probability, refresh rule or additive-stage example; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_stealth_duration_threat_damage_desc / f25397d4` | Threat weight is affected, with other AI factors still relevant; max 1 refreshes; Backstab 100→150 or 170 with an existing same-stage 20%. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_increased_duration.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These conditions and calculations supplement the stated bonuses. |

Gain +30% Damage Resistance for 8s upon exiting Stealth.”; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_stealth_toughness_dr_desc / cc97b988` | Entry restores 0.5 maximum Toughness; exit adds `damage_taken_multiplier=0.7` for 8s. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_leaving_stealth_restores_toughness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The exit qualifier applies to resistance; the first sentence does not explicitly assert restoration on exit. |
| Restoration basis, timing and damage limits | No maximum-versus-missing basis, cap, explicit entry timing or stacking rule; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_stealth_toughness_dr_desc / cc97b988` | Restoration occurs on entry and caps at missing Toughness; exit does not repeat it. General damage multiplier, max 1, duration begins on application. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_leaving_stealth_restores_toughness.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details explain the two effects and their limits without inventing an English timing error. |

[Fixed source and line references](zealot_restore_stealth_cd_on_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The direction, cap threshold and maximum additional regeneration agree under the accepted natural 1 resource/s basis. |
| Sampling, healing and elapsed recharge | No event requirement, sampling interval or full recharge time specified; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_damage_taken_restores_cd_new_description / 62f53f3a` | Periodic current-Health sampling, not an `on_damage` proc; healing lowers the bonus. Natural recharge and other effects remain separate. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_restore_stealth_cd_on_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The existing 22.5s/20s examples and update timing explain the stated regeneration. |

| Trigger and recharge bonus | “+75% Ability Cooldown Regeneration for 2s after a Melee Backstab or Melee Weakspot hit.”; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_cooldown_on_backstab_weakspot_desc / 169457dc` | Melee hit plus Backstab OR Weakspot; extra 0.75 resource/s, duration 2s. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_backstab_kills_restore_cd.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The current English describes hits, not the legacy internal name's kill requirement. |
| Refresh, timer and resource cap | No stacking, custom timer phase or resource-cap details; `ui / loc_talent_zealot_cooldown_on_backstab_weakspot_desc / 169457dc` | Max 1; repeated hits refresh duration without necessarily resetting the timer. Two settlements add about 1.5 resource under the stated assumptions. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_backstab_kills_restore_cd.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These qualify recharge timing; they do not contradict the hit-based bonus. |

| Trigger, regeneration and displayed precision | “+100% Ability Cooldown Regeneration for 3s on Melee Critical Hits.”; `ui / loc_talent_maniac_cooldown_on_melee_crits_buff_desc / ec418944` | Melee crit proc gives 1 additional resource/s; duration 3.25s, explicitly formatted with zero decimals. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_crits_grant_cd.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The hit type and rate agree. Display precision explains 3 versus internal 3.25 without claiming exact in-game timing. |
| Sweep gate and refresh timing | No per-sweep gate, refresh or timer-phase description; `ui / loc_talent_maniac_cooldown_on_melee_crits_buff_desc / ec418944` | One trigger per sweep; later sweeps can refresh duration without stacking the per-second rate; custom timer phase and resource cap remain relevant. [Fixed source and line references](zealot_crits_grant_cd.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The accepted three-tick example and limits supplement the regeneration statement. |

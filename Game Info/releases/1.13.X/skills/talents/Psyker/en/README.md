- **Trigger**: A damaging hit against an Elite, Specialist or Monstrosity triggers Brain Rupture when the target remains alive and the talent is off cooldown. Bombers and scenery objects are excluded.

- **Cooldown example**: After triggering at second 0, a hit at second 11 cannot trigger it again. The next qualifying hit after the 12-second cooldown ends triggers it.

### Brain Rupture

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/215cb557-8544-4d05-876a-871e70dc093a" width="72" height="72" alt="Brain Rupture talent icon">

- **How it works**: Charge psychic power to attack one enemy, dealing 50% more damage than the original base Blitz.

- **Charging modes**: You can charge before finding a target, reaching full charge in about 3 seconds. Locking a target before charging reaches full charge in about 2 seconds; you may move the crosshair away after locking. Charge-speed bonuses affect these times.

- **Peril example**: Without other modifiers, either mode adds about 20 percentage points of Peril while charging fully; a successful attack adds another 25 points, totaling about 20 + 25 = 45 points. Holding full charge adds about 9 points per additional second.

- **Damage example**: With the same target, charge level and other bonuses, an attack dealing 100 damage becomes 100 × 1.5 = 150. This illustrates the multiplier; actual damage varies with armour and attack conditions.

### Assail

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0c17626-2777-4302-bc7e-9b3a48aadcd0" width="72" height="72" alt="Assail talent icon">

- **How it works**: Throw psychic shards that home on targets. Aiming lets you choose an enemy and increases projectile speed.

- **Uses and recovery**: Holds up to 10 uses; each throw consumes one, with a base recovery of one use every 3 seconds. Uses share recovery progress and replenish sequentially.

- **Recovery example**: With no other recovery modifiers, starting at 0 uses with no remaining progress, one use returns at second 3 and two at second 6; filling all 10 takes 3 × 10 = 30 seconds.

- **Damage limits**: Hit location, target armour and penetration order affect damage; later penetrated targets cannot simply use the first enemy's damage.

- **Peril cost**: A normal throw adds 10 percentage points of Peril; an aimed throw adds 25. For example, an existing 40% becomes 50% or 65% respectively. Other Peril-generation modifiers apply separately.

- **How it works**: Assail's damage and impact penetration capacities increase by 50%, letting it pass through more enemies.

- **Penetration example**: With no other penetration modifiers, a capacity of 2 mass units becomes 2 × 1.5 = 3 mass units. Enemy masses vary, so this does not guarantee one additional enemy hit.

### Smite

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981d6617-da53-4f4d-8c85-c2e64dddab43" width="72" height="72" alt="Smite talent icon">

- **How it works**: Channel psychic lightning, electrocuting a target and spreading to nearby enemies. Whether enemies remain staggered depends on their resistance and actions. Charged casting accelerates propagation and damage buildup.

- **Spread**: Subsequent propagation reaches 5 + 1 = 6 metres. Quick casting starts with at most one jump and increases to 2, 3 and 4 jumps at 1.2, 1.8 and 2.7 seconds. Charged casting reaches those same limits at 0.4, 0.6 and 0.9 seconds. Enemy positions and line of sight still limit actual numbers.

- **Sustained damage**: Electrocution deals damage at random intervals of 0.1–0.3 seconds. Quick casting takes about 5 seconds to reach maximum intensity; charged casting takes about 2. Targets with greater resistance to penetration start taking damage later. Final damage also depends on enemy armour and bonuses.

- **Peril example**: Without other modifiers, quick casting adds about 0.75 Peril percentage points during its first 0.1 seconds, then about 22.5 points per second. Maintaining it for 0.35 seconds adds about 0.75 + 22.5 × 0.25 = 6.375 points. Completing the 0.8-second preparatory charge phase adds about 5 points during that phase.

- **How it works**: For 10 seconds after using your Combat Ability, Brain Rupture's charge speed increases by 75% and its generated Peril decreases by 50%.

- **Charging example**: With an original 2-second charge and no other bonuses, 2 ÷ 1.75 ≈ 1.14 seconds. An original 10 Peril percentage points becomes 10 × 0.5 = 5 points.

- **How it works**: Assail's use-recovery rate increases by 30%.

- **Recovery example**: With only this talent, the original 3 seconds per use becomes 3 ÷ 1.3 ≈ 2.31 seconds. Refilling 10 uses from empty takes about 30 ÷ 1.3 ≈ 23.08 seconds. A 30% faster recovery rate does not mean a 30% shorter wait.

- **How it works**: Enemies electrocuted by your Smite take 10% more damage; teammates' attacks also benefit. With Charged Strike, electrocution applied by melee heavy attacks has the same effect.

- **Damage example**: Isolating this target damage-taken multiplier with all other conditions equal, original damage of 100 becomes 100 × 1.1 = 110. The bonus ends when the electrocution effect is removed.

- **Trigger**: After a melee heavy attack hits an enemy, it electrocutes that target for 2 seconds and deals damage over that duration.

- **With Enfeeble**: This 2-second electrocution also increases the target's damage taken by 10%. Isolating that damage-taken multiplier, original damage of 100 becomes 100 × 1.1 = 110.

- **Aura**: You and teammates in Coherency deal 10% more damage against Elite enemies. The same aura does not stack multiple times.

- **Damage example**: Isolating this stage with a baseline of 100 and no other bonuses, 100 × 1.1 = 110. With an existing 25% bonus at the same stage, damage rises from 125 to 100 × (1 + 25% + 10%) = 135. Non-Elite enemies do not receive this bonus.

- **Aura**: You and teammates in Coherency gain 5 percentage points of Critical Hit Chance. The same aura does not stack multiple times.

- **Ability**: Unleash a wave of warp energy that Staggers Enemies in front of you and immediately Quells 50 percentage points of Peril. Base cooldown: 30 seconds.

- **Peril examples**: With no other simultaneous Peril changes, 80% Peril becomes 80% − 50 percentage points = 30%. At 40% Peril, subtracting 50 percentage points reaches the lower limit of 0%.

### Scrier's Gaze

- **Ability**: Activating Scrier's Gaze Quells 50 percentage points of Peril. While active, gain +10% Damage, 20 percentage points of Critical Chance, +10% Weakspot Damage, 20% Toughness Damage Reduction and Suppression Immunity.
- Gain another 1% Damage per second, up to +30%, and recover 2.5% of maximum Toughness per second. Peril builds while active; enemy Kills briefly slow its accumulation. At 100% Peril, Gaze ends, and the accumulated damage bonus remains for 10 seconds.
- **Damage example**: With no other bonuses, a non-Critical, non-Weakspot hit of 100 becomes `100 × (1 + 10% + 30%) = 140` at full stacks. After Gaze ends, only the accumulated 30% remains, giving 130.
- **Weakspot example**: Isolating the Weakspot Damage bonus, assume base damage 100 and extra Weakspot damage 50. The original 150 becomes `100 + 50 × 1.10 = 155`, about a 3.33% increase for the whole hit. Gaze's other damage bonuses are calculated separately.
- **Recovery and chance examples**: At 100 maximum Toughness, recover `100 × 2.5% = 2.5` per second, capped by missing Toughness. An original 5% Critical Chance becomes `5% + 20 percentage points = 25%`.
- Base cooldown: 25 seconds. Cooldown recovery pauses while the active Gaze buff exists and resumes after it ends, without other cooldown modifiers.

**Note on the Chinese wording**: The Chinese description says entering/leaving Gaze's “area,” which may suggest a ground zone. The corresponding English and accepted implementation describe the character entering and ending the Gaze state.

- **Ability modifier**: Each Enemy hit by Venting Shriek grants one stack of Peril Generation reduction for 5 seconds, up to 25 stacks.
- **Stack examples**: Using the accepted 0.99 coefficient per stack and no other Peril Generation modifiers, 10 eligible hits give `0.99^10 ≈ 0.9044`: about 90.44% of original generation, or 9.56% less. A gain of 10 Peril percentage points becomes `10 × 0.99^10 ≈ 9.04` points. At 25 stacks, `0.99^25 ≈ 0.7778`: about 77.78% of original generation, or 22.22% less; a gain of 10 points becomes about 7.78 points.
- This reduces new Peril Generation; it does not directly Quell existing Peril. The source also contains a 0.98 tier override. The examples use 0.99 and cannot be applied unchanged to a different tier/configuration.

- **Ability modifier**: Enemies hit by Venting Shriek deal 10% less damage and take 10% more damage for 8 seconds.

- **Damage example**: With no other bonuses, an Enemy originally dealing 100 damage now deals `100 × 0.9 = 90`; originally taking 100 damage, it now takes `100 × 1.1 = 110`.

- **Ability modifier**: Based on your Peril before casting Venting Shriek, apply 1–6 stacks of Soulblaze to hit Enemies. Sleeping Daemonhosts are not ignited by this effect.

- **Stack examples**: Multiply the Peril proportion by 6 and round up, with a minimum of 1 and maximum of 6 stacks. At 50%, `0.50 × 6 = 3` stacks; at 80%, `0.80 × 6 = 4.8` rounds up to 5. Even 0% Peril applies 1 stack.

- **Ability modifier**: During Scrier's Gaze, also gain 1% Finesse Damage each second, up to 30%, remaining for 10 seconds after it ends. Weakspot Kills add one stack of progress to both damage and Finesse Damage.

- **Stack example**: At 8 accumulated Gaze stacks, a Weakspot Kill gives `8 + 1 = 9` stacks. It does not extend the actual duration of Gaze.

- **Damage example**: Finesse Damage affects the extra Weakspot or Critical damage. Isolating a 30% Finesse bonus, assume base damage 100 and extra damage 50. The original 150 becomes `100 + 50 × 1.30 = 165`, a 10% increase for the whole hit; Gaze's other bonuses are calculated separately.

- **Trigger**: After personally killing an Elite or Specialist Enemy, gain an extra 0.5 seconds of Combat Ability cooldown recovery about once per second for 3 seconds. Triggering it again resets the effect's duration without increasing the amount restored by each tick.

- **Cooldown example**: With 20 seconds remaining, after 1 second of normal recovery and one extra recovery tick, the remaining cooldown becomes `20 − 1 − 0.5 = 18.5` seconds.

- **Full recovery amount**: With normal frame-by-frame updates and no interruption, three extra ticks restore `0.5 × 3 = 1.5` seconds in total, in addition to the cooldown time that naturally passes during this interval.

- **Ability modifier**: While Scrier's Gaze is active, generate 20% less Peril and take 30% less time to Quell the same amount of Peril.

- **Generation example**: An original gain of 10 Peril percentage points becomes `10 × 0.8 = 8` points. Existing accumulated Peril is not directly removed.

- **Quell example**: An original 10-second Quell process becomes `10 × 0.7 = 7` seconds. Expressed as a rate per second, this is `1 ÷ 0.7 ≈ 1.429` times the original rate, about 42.9% faster.

#### Chinese wording erratum

- The Chinese phrase “reduces already generated Peril” describes removing existing Peril. The corresponding English and accepted implementation refer to generating less new Peril while Gaze is active.

- **Ability**: Deploy a psychic shield in front of you, blocking Enemy Ranged Attacks while you and Allies can still shoot through. It lasts up to 17.5 seconds; base cooldown: 40 seconds.

- **Shield durability**: The shield withstands 20 hits that are accepted for durability removal. After each removal, no further durability is removed for 0.33 seconds. Heavy attack pressure may destroy the shield early.

- **Durability example**: After 12 accepted durability removals, `20 − 12 = 8` remain. This counts shield hits and is separate from your Health or Toughness.

- **Ability modifier**: Telekine Shield gains one extra charge, storing up to 2. The two uses share cooldown progress and restore one charge at a time.

- **Cooldown example**: After both charges are exhausted, recover the first after 40 seconds and the second after another 40, for `40 × 2 = 80` seconds in total. Other cooldown bonuses are calculated separately.

- **Ability modifier**: With Telekine Dome selected, you and Allies inside the spherical shield recover 10% of maximum Toughness per second.

- **Dissipation effect**: When the shield dissipates, players still inside gain 50% Toughness Damage Reduction for 5 seconds. Leaving early does not grant this dissipation bonus.

- **Recovery and reduction example**: At 100 maximum Toughness, recover `100 × 10% = 10` per second, up to 30 over 3 seconds, capped by missing Toughness. During the reduction effect, an original 40 Toughness damage becomes `40 × 0.5 = 20`.

### Telekine Dome

- **Ability modifier**: Telekine Shield becomes a spherical barrier around the casting position, with a radius of about 6 metres. It lasts up to 25 seconds; base cooldown becomes 60 seconds. The shield can still disappear early when its durability is exhausted.

- **Time comparison**: Compared with the original shield, duration increases by `25 − 17.5 = 7.5` seconds and cooldown by `60 − 40 = 20` seconds. Durability still supports 20 accepted removals.

- **Ability modifier**: Enemies passing through your Telekine Shield have a 20% chance to be Electrocuted. Specialist Enemies and Monsters always trigger the effect; whether it interrupts an action still depends on the Enemy's resistance.

- **Shield cost**: A Specialist trigger also damages the shield, subject to its 0.33-second durability-removal interval.

- **Chance example**: Each eligible ordinary-Enemy crossing has a 20% chance. Across 100 crossings, expected triggers are `100 × 20% = 20`, rather than a guaranteed trigger every five crossings.

- **Ability modifier**: After Scrier's Gaze ends, retain protection from Peril overload; Peril still accumulates normally.

- **Duration**: The 10-second post-Gaze effect plus a 1.5-second buffer gives `10 + 1.5 = 11.5` seconds. Gaze itself still ends at 100% Peril.

- **Gaining and retaining charges:** Personally kill an Elite or Specialist Enemy to gain one Warp Charge, up to four stacks, lasting 25 seconds. Gaining another charge resets the shared timer. Expiry removes one stack and restarts the 25-second countdown.

- **Damage example:** Each stack adds 4% Damage. With no other bonuses, four stacks turn 100 Damage into `100 × (1 + 4% × 4) = 116`; six stacks with Warp Battery give 124.

- **Cooldown example:** Using a Combat Ability spends every Warp Charge. Each restores 7.5% of the cooldown required for one use of that ability. For a 30-second cooldown and four stacks, this immediately restores `30 × 7.5% × 4 = 9` seconds of progress, leaving about 21 seconds.

- **Abilities with multiple charges:** Restoration first fills the charge currently counting down; any progress exceeding the amount required for that charge carries over to subsequent charges.

### Disrupt Destiny

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/885fdda1-bcf2-4502-97e0-7eaead2392e0" width="72" height="72" alt="Disrupt Destiny talent icon">

- **Marking and stacks:** Mark eligible enemies in front of you, within 40 metres and with line of sight. Personally kill the current Marked Enemy to gain one Precision stack, up to 15.

- **Per-stack bonuses:** +1% general Damage, +2% additional Critical Damage and +2.5% additional Weakspot Damage. At 15 stacks these are +15%, +30% and +37.5%, respectively.

- **Damage examples:** With only the general Damage bonus, `100 × (1 + 15%) = 115`. For the Weakspot bonus alone, suppose the same hit already includes the general Damage bonus and has a base portion of 100 plus an additional Weakspot portion of 50. Adding 37.5% Weakspot Damage gives `100 + 50 × 1.375 = 168.75`, a 12.5% increase over the original 150 at this stage. Weapons have different additional-Damage proportions, so the increase to the whole hit varies.

- **Toughness and Movement Speed:** Killing the Marked target restores 25% of maximum Toughness over 2.5 seconds and grants +20% Movement Speed for 2.5 seconds. At 100 maximum Toughness, this restores 25 in total, or `25 ÷ 2.5 = 10` per second, capped by missing Toughness.

- **Timer refresh and decay:** Precision shares a five-second timer. Gaining a stack, or hitting a still-living Marked target or a Boss while stacks already exist, resets it. Expiry removes one stack, then starts another five-second timer. With three stacks and no further refresh, the count falls to two, one and zero at about 5, 10 and 15 seconds.

### Empowered Psionics

- **Gaining and spending empowerment:** Kills have a 10% chance to grant one empowerment stack, with a base storage limit of one. Each empowered Blitz spends one stack; Smite spends it when that continuous cast ends.

- **Brain Rupture:** Generates no Peril, gains +50% Damage and +50% charge speed. Without other Damage bonuses, `100 × 1.5 = 150`. A two-second charge becomes `2 ÷ 1.5 ≈ 1.33` seconds, about 33.3% shorter.

- **Smite:** Gains +200% Damage. Without other Damage bonuses, `100 × (1 + 200%) = 300`.

- **Assail:** Generates no Peril and spends no throw charges, with increased Damage and piercing capacity; it still spends one empowerment stack. Cleave capacity rises from two to four, or `4 ÷ 2 = 2` times the capacity. The number of enemies actually pierced depends on enemies and hit conditions.

- **Chance example:** If storage is available on every kill, 100 kills give an expected `100 × 10% = 10` empowerments; there is no guaranteed trigger every ten kills.

- **How it works:** Each Warp Charge reduces Peril Generation by 8%. Four stacks give a 32% reduction; six with Warp Battery give 48%.

- **Peril example:** An attack that originally generates 10 percentage points of Peril generates `10 × (1 − 8% × 4) = 6.8` at four stacks, or 5.2 at six. Other Generation modifiers apply separately.

- **How it works:** Gaining a Warp Charge restores 30% of maximum Toughness over five seconds. Gaining another during the effect resets the five-second timer; the restoration rate does not stack.

- **Restoration example:** With 100 maximum Toughness, restore `100 × 30% ÷ 5 = 6` per second, or 30 over a full five seconds. If only 12 is missing, at most 12 can actually be restored.

- **How it works:** The chance to gain empowerment on killing an enemy rises from 10% to 15%; the storage cap does not change.

- **Chance example:** With storage available each time, the expected number of empowerments from 100 kills rises from `100 × 10% = 10` to `100 × 15% = 15`. Random outcomes are not guaranteed to equal the expectation.

- **Trigger:** While holding empowerment, use an empowered Blitz to restore 20% of maximum Toughness to you and each Ally in Coherency. Smite restores it when casting starts, Assail when thrown, and Brain Rupture when the attack resolves.

- **Restoration example:** A player with 100 maximum Toughness restores `100 × 20% = 20`; one with 150 restores 30. Each is capped by their own missing Toughness. Hitting more enemies with a single Smite does not increase this restoration.

- **Trigger:** Killing an Elite Enemy guarantees one empowerment stack. Specialist and ordinary enemies retain the existing gain chance.

- **Stack example:** Killing an Elite at zero stacks gives one. The base cap is one, so another kill at the cap does not give two. Charged Up raises the cap to three.

- **How it works:** Disrupt Destiny's Precision cap increases from 15 to 25 stacks. Per-stack effects and the rule of losing one stack every five seconds remain unchanged.

- **Damage example:** At 25 stacks, gain +25% general Damage, +50% additional Critical Damage and +62.5% additional Weakspot Damage. With only general Damage, `100 × (1 + 25%) = 125`. The additional Critical and Weakspot portions require separate calculation for each weapon.

- **Trigger:** Personally kill Disrupt Destiny's current Marked Enemy to immediately Quell five percentage points of Peril.

- **Peril example:** At 60% Peril, `60% − 5 percentage points = 55%`. At 3%, Peril falls to 0%.

- **How it works:** Disrupt Destiny's Precision timer before each one-stack decay increases from five to ten seconds. Gaining a stack or hitting a qualifying target can still refresh the countdown.

- **Time example:** With three stacks and no subsequent refresh, the count falls to two, one and zero at about 10, 20 and 30 seconds. Full decay originally took about `5 × 3 = 15` seconds; it now takes about `10 × 3 = 30`.

- **How it works:** Empowered Psionics' storage cap rises from one to three stacks. Each empowered Blitz still spends one; storing more stacks does not increase a single empowerment's multiplier.

- **Stack example:** At two stacks, gaining one gives `2 + 1 = 3`. At three, another gain leaves the count at three.

- **Trigger:** If an enemy still has Soulblaze when it dies, or your Soulblaze deals the killing Damage, there is a 10% chance to gain one Warp Charge. The first condition does not require you to land the last hit.

- **Chance example:** Without truncation at the charge cap, 100 qualifying death events give an expected `100 × 10% = 10` stacks. Actual results depend on random rolls.

- **Selection limit:** Choose either In Fire Reborn or Psychic Vampire.

- **Trigger:** When you or an Ally in Coherency kills an enemy, you have a 4% chance to gain one Warp Charge. Allies do not receive your charge from this effect.

- **Chance example:** With storage available each time, 100 qualifying kills have expected gain `100 × 4% = 4` stacks; there is no guaranteed gain every 25 kills.

- **How it works:** Warp Charge storage increases from four to six stacks. Damage and cooldown effects per stack remain unchanged.

- **Damage example:** Six stacks give `6 × 4% = 24%` Damage. Without other bonuses, `100 × 1.24 = 124`. This is eight more than 116 at the original four-stack cap.

- **Cooldown example:** Six stacks restore `6 × 7.5% = 45%` of one ability charge's cooldown; for a 30-second cooldown, this restores 13.5 seconds of progress.

- **Trigger:** Kill Disrupt Destiny's current Marked Enemy with a Weakspot hit to gain two Precision stacks in addition to the original one, for three in total. Killing an unmarked enemy does not trigger this effect.

- **Trigger:** Kill an enemy with a Warp Attack to restore 7.5% of maximum Toughness.

- **Restoration example:** At 100 maximum Toughness with no other restoration bonuses, each proc restores `100 × 7.5% = 7.5`. If current Toughness is 96, effective restoration is `100 − 96 = 4`.

- **How it works:** Both rising and falling Peril restore Toughness. Each ten-percentage-point change restores 4% of maximum Toughness, proportional to the actual change.

- **Restoration example:** At 100 maximum Toughness with no other restoration bonuses, increasing Peril from 40% to 60% restores `100 × 20% × 0.4 = 8`. Subsequently reducing it from 60% to 50% restores another `100 × 10% × 0.4 = 4`. Full Toughness cannot be overfilled.

- **Ordinary hit**: hitting the first enemy with a melee attack restores 2.5% of maximum Toughness.

- **Weakspot Kill**: a melee hit that kills an enemy through its Weakspot instead restores 15% of maximum Toughness over 3 seconds; this kill does not also grant the preceding 2.5%. Triggering it again resets the 3 seconds without stacking the restoration rate.

- **Restoration example**: with 100 maximum Toughness, no other bonuses and a sufficient deficit, an ordinary hit restores 2.5 points. A Weakspot Kill restores 100 × 15% ÷ 3 = 5 points per second, for 15 points over 3 seconds.

- **Trigger**: after a Critical Hit, restore 10% of maximum Toughness over 4 seconds and gain 5% Movement Speed.

- **Stacks and refresh**: Movement Speed stacks up to 3 times, for a total increase of 15%; triggering the effect again resets the 4 seconds. Toughness continues to regenerate at 2.5% of maximum per second and does not multiply with the Movement Speed stack count.

- **Restoration example**: with 100 maximum Toughness, a sufficient deficit and no other bonuses, the 4-second effect restores 100 × 10% = 10 points. At 3 stacks it still restores 2.5 points per second, while the movement multiplier is 1 + 3 × 5% = 1.15.

- **Trigger**: killing an Elite or Specialist enemy applies 2 Soulblaze stacks to enemies within 4 metres of the victim.

- **Stack example**: a nearby enemy with no Soulblaze receives 2 stacks; one with 3 stacks reaches 3 + 2 = 5 stacks. Damage grows nonlinearly with stacks; 5 stacks do not deal 5 times the damage of 1 stack.

- **Effect**: Peril Generation is reduced by 10%; each Kill has a 10% chance to remove 10 percentage points of Peril.

- **Peril example**: an attack that normally generates 20 percentage points of Peril instead generates 20 × 0.9 = 18 percentage points. When the kill effect triggers, 50% Peril falls to 40%; if only 6% remains, it falls to 0%.

- **Proc chance**: 10% is the chance on each Kill; it does not guarantee one proc for every 10 enemies killed.

- **Damage example**: compare only this damage-bonus stage, with all other multipliers fixed at 1. With a baseline of 100 points and no other bonus, 100 × (1 + 15%) = 115 points. With an existing 25% bonus in the same stage, Damage rises from 125 to 100 × (1 + 25% + 15%) = 140 points.

- **Trigger**: when an enemy affected by your Soulblaze dies, distribute up to 4 stacks among enemies within 5 metres; the final hit does not have to come from Soulblaze.

- **Distribution**: the total available cannot exceed the victim's stack count at death. This spread also cannot raise any recipient above that stack ceiling.

- **Stack example**: if the victim had 6 stacks and two nearby eligible enemies each had 0, the shared total is min(6, 4) = 4. Giving them 1 stack in turn leaves each with 2 stacks. With only one eligible target, that target can receive 4 stacks.

#### Existing Traditional Chinese text correction

- The Traditional Chinese wording narrows the trigger to being burned to death by your Soulblaze. The English and verified execution condition require the enemy to be affected by your Soulblaze when it dies; another attack can deliver the killing blow.

- **Effect**: remove the movement penalties caused by Quelling Peril and Reloading, and gain 5% Movement Speed. Slows from other sources are still calculated separately.

- **Effect**: a kill with non-Warp Damage grants 5% Warp Damage; a kill with Warp Damage grants 5% non-Warp Damage.

- **Stacks and refresh**: the two groups each have a separate cap of 5 stacks and last 10 seconds. Gaining the same group's effect again resets that group's timer. Each group at full stacks adds 25% Damage.

- **Damage example**: compare only this damage-bonus stage, with all other multipliers fixed at 1. With a baseline of 100 points and no other bonus, 100 × (1 + 25%) = 125 points. With an existing 25% bonus in the same stage, Damage rises from 125 to 100 × (1 + 25% + 25%) = 150 points.

- **Effect**: higher Peril provides stronger Toughness Damage Reduction. It is 10% at 0% Peril and 33% at 100% Peril, with proportional changes between them.

- **Reduction example**: at 50% Peril, the reduction is 10% + (33% − 10%) × 50% = 21.5%. An original 100 points of Toughness Damage becomes 100 × 0.785 = 78.5 points; with another independent 20% reduction it becomes 78.5 × 0.8 = 62.8 points. This effect does not reduce Health Damage.

### Anticipation

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b2261c-4df6-4531-b9c1-bf67fbbbdcee" width="72" height="72" alt="Anticipation talent icon">

- **Effect**: gain 1 additional Effective Dodge and increase the protection linger time after the dodge action ends by 50%.

- **Example**: a weapon with 3 consecutive Effective Dodges gains 3 + 1 = 4. If the original linger time was 0.2 seconds, it becomes 0.2 × 1.5 = 0.3 seconds; this does not mean the entire dodge action lasts 50% longer.

#### Existing Traditional Chinese text correction

- The Traditional Chinese wording says the Effective Dodge count increases to the specified number, treating the bonus as a new total. The English says to increase the count by that number; the verified effect adds 1 to the existing count, rather than allowing only 1 dodge in total.

- **Effect**: after a Critical Hit, count as Dodging against Ranged Attacks for 1 second; triggering it again resets the duration.

- **Timing example**: a proc at 0 seconds lasts until approximately 1 second. Another proc at 0.6 seconds extends it until approximately 1.6 seconds.

- **Scope**: this is a ranged-dodge check. It does not provide melee invulnerability, and explosions or ground fire cannot all be treated as ranged hits to which it grants immunity.

- **Effect**: the time needed to actively Quell Peril is reduced by 30%.

- **Timing example**: with the same weapon, starting Peril and other conditions, a Quelling process that took 4 seconds becomes approximately 4 × 0.7 = 2.8 seconds. The processing rate per second is 1 ÷ 0.7 ≈ 1.429 times the original, approximately 42.9% faster.

- **Effect**: the Damage bonus rises proportionally with current Peril. At 0% / 50% / 100% Peril, it grants 0% / 10% / 20% Damage respectively.

- **Damage example**: at 50% Peril, with a baseline Damage of 100 at this stage and all other multipliers fixed at 1, 100 × (1 + 20% × 50%) = 110 points. With an existing 25% bonus in the same stage, Damage rises from 125 to 135 points.

- **Effect**: after accumulating 5 valid Weakspot Hits that deal damage, the next Ranged Attack is guaranteed to be Critical and consumes this accumulated effect.

- **Accumulation limits**: repeated hits by the same projectile and later enemies cleaved by one attack cannot all be counted as an additional stack.

- **Example**: from 0 stacks, five separately valid Weakspot Hits give 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 stacks. The following Ranged Critical Strike consumes this effect. Critical Damage still depends on the weapon, hit location and target; it is not a fixed doubling.

- **Effect**: increase the Coherency Aura radius by 75%, allowing more distant allies to remain in Coherency.

- **Range example**: with other modifiers unchanged, an original radius of 8 metres becomes 8 × 1.75 = 14 metres. The increase is to radius; when comparing only the area of a flat circle, the area multiplier is 1.75² = 3.0625.

#### Existing Traditional Chinese text correction

- The Traditional Chinese wording says the Aura range becomes {radius_modifier} times the original, mixing a multiplier with a bonus amount. The verified effect increases radius by 75%, making it 1.75 times the original.

- **Effect**: below 97% Peril, Blocking first generates Peril. The conversion is 25% of the original Stamina cost as a fraction of maximum Stamina. Once Peril reaches 97%, the remaining Block cost is paid with Stamina.

- **Block example**: with 4 maximum Stamina, a Block that originally costs 2, and no other Peril modifiers, gain 2 ÷ 4 × 25% = 12.5 percentage points of Peril. Starting at 50% gives 62.5%, with no Stamina spent on this Block.

- **Near the cap**: if the same Block starts at 90%, only 7 percentage points fit. The remaining 12.5 − 7 = 5.5 percentage points convert back to 5.5% ÷ 25% × 4 = 0.88 Stamina.

- **Effect**: increase maximum Toughness by 15 points.

- **Toughness example**: with no other modifiers, 100 maximum Toughness becomes 100 + 15 = 115 points; selecting another node with the same effect gives 130 points. This increases the maximum rather than restoring Toughness over time.

- **Effect**: reduce Toughness Damage by 10% in this reduction stage; this does not reduce Health Damage.

- **Reduction example**: with an original 100 points of Toughness Damage and no other reduction in this stage, 100 × (1 − 10%) = 90 points. With an existing 5% reduction in the same stage, 100 × (1 − 5% − 10%) = 85 points. Other independent multiplicative reductions apply separately.

- **Effect**: increase Melee Attack Speed by 10%.

- **Timing example**: comparing only the action segment affected by Attack Speed, a segment that originally takes 1 second with no other Attack Speed bonuses becomes 1 ÷ 1.1 ≈ 0.909 seconds. This does not mean the entire combo always takes 10% less time.

### Warp Splitting

- **How it works**: Higher Peril allows attacks to pass through more total enemy mass: +50% at 50% Peril and +100% at 100% Peril.

- **Cleave example**: With a baseline damage Cleave capacity of 4 mass units, 50% Peril and no other bonuses, 4 × (1 + 50%) = 6. This does not increase damage to a single enemy by 50% and cannot be converted directly into a fixed number of extra enemies hit.

#### Traditional Chinese wording correction

- The Chinese phrase meaning “Cleave attack damage” presents Cleave capacity as a damage increase. The English says Cleave; the effect raises the enemy mass limit an attack can pass through, rather than directly increasing damage per hit.

- **Trigger**: When an enemy affected by Soulblaze dies, or you kill an enemy with Soulblaze, restore 15% of maximum Toughness over 5 seconds and gain 5 percentage points of Critical Hit Chance.

- **Refresh**: Another trigger resets the 5-second duration. The restoration rate and Critical Hit Chance bonus do not stack.

- **Restoration and chance example**: With 100 maximum Toughness, enough missing Toughness and no other modifiers, restore 100 × 15% ÷ 5 = 3 points per second. An initial 10% Critical Hit Chance becomes 10% + 5% = 15%.

- **Trigger**: Kill an enemy with a melee Weakspot hit to remove 10 percentage points of Peril. Peril generation is reduced by 20% for the next 4 seconds. Another trigger refreshes the duration.

- **Peril example**: A trigger at 60% Peril lowers it to 50%. During the effect, an attack that would generate 20 percentage points generates 20 × 0.8 = 16 percentage points.

- **How it works**: Deal 20% more Damage to Ogryns and Monstrosities.

- **Damage example**: Compare only this Damage stage, with all other multipliers fixed at 1. With a baseline of 100 and no other bonuses, 100 × (1 + 20%) = 120. With an existing 25% bonus in the same stage, 125 becomes 100 × (1 + 25% + 20%) = 145.

- **How it works**: Warp Damage increases by 15%. Eligibility depends on the attack's Damage type, rather than its weapon name.

- **Damage example**: Compare only this Damage stage, with all other multipliers fixed at 1. With a baseline of 100 and no other bonuses, 100 × (1 + 15%) = 115. With an existing 25% bonus in the same stage, 125 becomes 100 × (1 + 25% + 15%) = 140.

### Peril Equilibrium

- **How it works**: A non-Warp melee or ranged hit that deals Damage adds 2 percentage points of Peril, up to 75%. It stops adding Peril at 75% and does not lower Peril that is already above that threshold.

- **Peril example**: Three successive triggers at 70% Peril give 70% → 72% → 74% → 75%. An initial 90% remains at 90%.

- **How it works**: At no more than 80% Peril, gain 30% Reload Speed. If the threshold condition still holds when the reload completes, generate Peril according to the fraction of the clip restored.

- **Reload example**: Compare only the segment affected by Reload Speed. A segment that originally takes 3 seconds becomes 3 ÷ 1.3 ≈ 2.31 seconds.

- **Peril example**: With a 40-round clip, 20 rounds restored and no other Peril modifiers, gain 20 ÷ 40 × 15% = 7.5 percentage points of Peril. Restoring a full clip adds 15 percentage points.

#### English wording correction

- “Below 80% Peril” excludes exactly 80%, but the verified condition is Peril ≤80%.

- **Explosion effect**: Overload Explosion Damage increases by 100% and radius by 25%, changing the cost of surviving the explosion.

- **Wound cost**: After an explosion, ordinarily remove one Wound; with only one Wound left, you die. If this explosion kills an Elite enemy, its Wound cost is waived.

- **Damage and radius example**: Compare only these two modifiers. An original 100 explosion Damage becomes 100 × 2 = 200; an original 10-metre explosion radius becomes 10 × 1.25 = 12.5 metres. Actual Damage remains subject to distance falloff and enemy armour.

- **Alternating attacks**: After a Force Staff charge exceeds 95% and the charge action finishes, Primary Attack Damage increases by 20% for 5 seconds. After a Primary Attack action finishes, Secondary Attack Damage increases by 10% for 5 seconds.

- **Refresh**: The bonuses have separate timers and can coexist. Repeated triggers reset the corresponding 5-second timer without stacking the same bonus.

- **Damage example**: Compare each bonus's own Damage stage, with both attacks originally dealing 100 and no other bonuses. Primary Attacks deal 100 × 1.2 = 120; Secondary Attacks deal 100 × 1.1 = 110. The bonuses affect different attacks and cannot be combined into a 30% increase on one hit.

- **How it works**: A Force Staff Primary Attack hit makes that enemy take 6% more Warp Damage per stack, with stacks multiplying. Both your and your Allies' Warp Attacks benefit.

- **Stacks and refresh**: Up to 5 stacks, lasting 10 seconds. Another hit adds a stack and resets the duration; hits at maximum stacks still refresh it.

- **Damage example**: A target originally taking 100 Warp Damage takes 100 × 1.06 = 106 at one stack. At five stacks, 100 × 1.06⁵ ≈ 133.82, an increase of approximately 33.82%.

# Psyker: original game English comparison

[繁體中文](../LOCALIZATION_COMPARISON.md) | [Player descriptions](README.md) | [Technical index](SOURCE_INDEX.md)

- Original: local Steam Build 25606770, extracted 2026-10-02, UI resource. English and Traditional Chinese pair by the same description key/hash. Full text is stored under this release's `source/SteamBuild_25606770_1.13.1/`; that Build directory is Git-ignored.
- Mechanisms: Release 1.13.1 / `7e662fcda16219d775b84af50322be2e9cd9d62e`. Text and source both correspond to 1.13.1; actual in-game presentation remains unobserved.
- Read game English independently against previously verified evidence. Only explicit contradictions in effect direction, target, condition, quantity or unit count as English errata. Omitted mechanics and examples are supplementary.
- Placeholder displays are static reconstructions from the original template, existing verified values and necessary display mappings; they are not observed game screens. `[Dev]` / `[Writer]` export suffixes are metadata.

## Kinetic Flayer

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_smite_on_hit.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `14d069c4`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_smite_on_hit_special_elite_desc / 63bc627a`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enemy groups, chance and cooldown | `against Specialists, Elites and Monstrosities`; `100% chance on Hit`; `Cooldown of 12s`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_smite_on_hit_special_elite_desc / 63bc627a` | The tree places the node under Brain Rupture; eligible living enemy tags, event chance 1.0 and cooldown 12 match the accepted evidence. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_smite_on_hit.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Enemy scope and configured chance/timing agree. |
| Critical Peril restriction | `This cannot occur while at critical Peril`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_smite_on_hit_special_elite_desc / 63bc627a` | The accepted complete `check_proc_func` / `proc_func` inspection found no critical-Peril or Warp Charge gate; the evidence retains an unresolved difference. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_smite_on_hit.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | Preserve the existing uncertainty about actual in-game behavior; no new tracing was performed. |
| Additional trigger checks and damage calculation | `All Attacks ... on Hit`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_smite_on_hit_special_elite_desc / 63bc627a` | Requires attack type, nonzero damage and a living breed target; excludes bombers/props/living props; triggered `smite` damage receives the applicable Brain Rupture multiplier. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_smite_on_hit.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The English omits these checks and damage details without a conflicting numeric claim. |

## Brain Rupture

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_brain_burst_improved.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `c3b5cefd`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_brain_burst_improved_description / 681e4980`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single-target charged attack and damage bonus | `Charge up your Psychic Power`; `Single Enemy`; `augmented version of Brain Burst dealing +50% Damage`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_brain_burst_improved_description / 681e4980` | Uses the charged `psyker_smite_kill` single-target attack with `damage_type=smite`; the installed buff multiplies the relevant damage stage by 1.5. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_brain_burst_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The charged attack scope and reconstructed increase agree with the existing evidence. |
| Modes, lock conditions, costs and damage limits | `Charge up ... release it`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_brain_burst_improved_description / 681e4980` | Normal and sticky charge modes differ in target locking/timing; base full-charge Peril is about 20% plus fixed 25% on a damaging hit, with 9%/second while holding full charge; final damage varies by target and modifiers. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_brain_burst_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The English makes no conflicting claim about these omitted timings, costs or calculation details. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Homing projectiles and armour effectiveness | `swift, homing projectiles formed of psychic energy`; `Less effective versus Carapace Armoured Enemies`; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_blitz_throwing_knives_description / 72fc17b1` | Normal and aimed projectiles track targets through True Flight; `super_armor` uses the accepted reduced attack/impact curves. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_grenade_throwing_knives.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Projectile behavior and reduced armour effectiveness agree. |
| Uses, aiming, recovery and Peril | No count, recovery period, aiming settings or Peril cost stated; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_blitz_throwing_knives_description / 72fc17b1` | Maximum 10 uses; cost/regeneration gives 3 seconds per use, sequentially; aimed speed is 40 versus normal 20; normal/aimed Peril costs are 10/25 percentage points and damage varies by target/hit order. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_grenade_throwing_knives.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Omitted numeric and aiming details do not contradict the English's general description. |


<a id="psyker_throwing_knives_piercing"></a>

## Ethereal Shards

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_throwing_knives_piercing.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `d81ea964`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_throwing_knives_pierce_description / 392c597f`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Additional penetration | `Projectiles from Assail now pierce additional targets`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_throwing_knives_pierce_description / 392c597f` | The installed buff increases both attack and impact hit-mass capacities by +0.5 as additive multipliers, giving 1.5 times the original limits without other modifiers. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_throwing_knives_piercing.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The English describes increased penetration without guaranteeing a specific extra target count. |
| Magnitude, mass basis and variant distinction | No numeric increase or fixed target count stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_throwing_knives_pierce_description / 392c597f` | Limits measure attack/impact hit mass, not enemy count; target mass and projectile rules govern penetration. The empowered `psyker_throwing_knives_pierce` profile is a different variant. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_throwing_knives_piercing.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The 50% magnitude, examples and variant distinction are additional detail, not a conflicting translation. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Channelled lock, electrocution, propagation and charging | `channelled attack that Locks to and Stuns an Enemy while dealing Damage`; `spreads to nearby Enemies`; `Charge to increase Spread rate and Damage`; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_chain_lightning_description / 837f8e7f` | Quick and charged chain actions electrocute targets and propagate nearby; charged schedules spread faster and the damage charge curve fills in 2 seconds versus 5. Actual stagger remains subject to enemy resistance/actions. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_grenade_chain_lightning.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated behavior and direction of charged improvements agree with existing evidence. |
| Separate limits and numerical details | No root/jump limits, radius, intervals, hit-mass delay, power scalar or Peril costs stated; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_chain_lightning_description / 837f8e7f` | Roots and subsequent jumps have independent schedules; the current Blitz adds one jump and one metre, giving 6-metre propagation. Tick delays/intervals and conditional Peril/damage examples retain their separate calculations. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_grenade_chain_lightning.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The English omits internal schedules and costs without guaranteeing a conflicting hit count or numerical value. |

## Kinetic Resonance

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_ability_increase_brain_burst_speed.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `fc3add45`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_ability_increase_brain_burst_speed_desc / ee94ffdd`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger, duration, charge speed and generated Peril | `Using your Combat Ability`; `Brain Rupture charge +75% faster`; `generate 50% less Peril for 10s`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_ability_increase_brain_burst_speed_desc / ee94ffdd` | `on_combat_ability` adds `psyker_efficient_smites` for 10 seconds; `smite_attack_speed=0.75` and `warp_charge_amount_smite=0.5`. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_ability_increase_brain_burst_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The English's trigger, duration and effect directions/values agree. |
| Reciprocal timing and example assumptions | `charge ... faster`, without a percentage decrease in charge time; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_ability_increase_brain_burst_speed_desc / ee94ffdd` | Speed 1+0.75=1.75 divides the original duration: 2÷1.75≈1.14 seconds, about 42.86% less time; actual timing/cost depends on action and other modifiers. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_ability_increase_brain_burst_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The formula and limits clarify the effect without contradicting the speed wording. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Charge replenishment rate | `Assail charges Replenish {recharge%s} faster`; mapped value `30%`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_throwing_knives_cast_speed_description / da103b93` | The current passive installs `psyker_reduced_throwing_knife_cooldown`, providing regeneration multiplier 1+0.3=1.3; it does not install the retained stacking-speed proc. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_throwing_knives_cast_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Charge replenishment and its mapped increase agree; static substitution does not claim observed game rendering. |
| Time conversion, recovery limits and unused fields | No wait-time percentage reduction or stacking-speed benefit stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_throwing_knives_cast_speed_description / da103b93` | One use takes 3÷1.3≈2.31 seconds; a 30% rate increase reduces the wait by about 23.08%. Other modifiers/pauses apply; retained 8-second/5-stack/5%-per-stack speed definitions are inactive here. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_throwing_knives_cast_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These omitted formulas, limits and unused definitions do not contradict the English. |

## Enfeeble

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_chain_lightning_improved_target_buff.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `030a19d8`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_chain_lightning_improved_target_buff_alt_description / da40a0a2`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Affected target, value and all-source scope | `Enemies Electrocuted by you take +10% increased Base Damage from all sources`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_chain_lightning_improved_target_buff_alt_description / da40a0a2` | The improved target template sets `damage_taken_multiplier=1.1`; shared calculation multiplies base damage by the target multiplier, including attacks from teammates/other sources. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_chain_lightning_improved_target_buff.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Target, affected calculation stage, magnitude and source scope agree. |
| Removal and Charged Strike interaction | No removal rule or heavy-attack interaction stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_chain_lightning_improved_target_buff_alt_description / da40a0a2` | Smite removes the controlled electrocution effect when the target leaves the chain; Charged Strike can apply the improved 2-second version under this special rule. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_chain_lightning_improved_target_buff.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The omitted duration/removal and talent interaction supplement the wording. |

## Charged Strike

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_chain_lightning_heavy_attacks.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `b2c5eb1f`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_chain_lightning_damage_heavy_attacks_desc / e84d2a21`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy melee hit and electrocution damage | `Your Heavy Melee Attacks electrocute enemies hit, damaging them`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_chain_lightning_damage_heavy_attacks_desc / e84d2a21` | `CheckProcFunctions.on_heavy_hit` filters the proc; the hit target receives `psyker_heavy_swings_shock`, which deals sustained electrocution damage. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_chain_lightning_heavy_attacks.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger and damage effect agree with the accepted evidence. |
| Duration, stacking and Enfeeble | No duration, stack limit or Enfeeble interaction stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_chain_lightning_damage_heavy_attacks_desc / e84d2a21` | Electrocution lasts 2 seconds with maximum 1 stack; Enfeeble selects the improved all-source 1.1 damage-taken variant. Damage is not a universal fixed melee bonus. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_chain_lightning_heavy_attacks.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | Omitted duration, limits and interaction are supplementary. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recipients, enemy category and damage value | `+10% Damage against Elite Enemies for you and Allies in Coherency`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_base_3_description / 4fad8ca6` | Self-inclusive Coherency applies the aura to the player and teammates; `damage_vs_elites=0.1` enters attacker damage modifiers only for targets with the `elite` tag. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_aura_damage_vs_elites.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Beneficiaries, Elite-only scope and reconstructed magnitude agree. |
| Stack limit and additive calculation | No stacking cap or other-bonus formula stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_base_3_description / 4fad8ca6` | Maximum 1 aura stack; bonuses at the same stage add, so an existing +25% gives 100×(1+0.25+0.1)=135 rather than treating the aura as a separate universal final multiplier. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_aura_damage_vs_elites.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The stack rule and conditional example supplement the English. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recipients and cooldown reduction | `+10% Cooldown Reduction on Abilities for you and Allies in Coherency`; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_cooldown_aura_improved_description / 8daf59be` | Self-inclusive Coherency applies the aura; `combat_ability_resource_cost_per_use_modifier=−0.1` scales each use's resource cost to 0.9 at unchanged other modifiers. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_cooldown_aura_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Beneficiaries and the direction/magnitude of cooldown reduction agree. |
| Stack cap and timing assumptions | No stack limit, application timing or resource/time formula stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_cooldown_aura_improved_description / 8daf59be` | Maximum 1 stack; at fixed recovery speed, an original 40/60-second charge becomes 36/54 seconds. Other cooldown modifiers, multi-charge behavior and recovery rules affect actual time. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_cooldown_aura_improved.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The calculation basis and limits supplement the English. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recipients, stat and value | `You and Allies in Coherency gain +5% Critical Hit Chance`; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_gunslinger_aura_description / a2000c1d` | Self-inclusive Coherency grants `critical_strike_chance=0.05`; shared calculation adds it to archetype base chance and relevant bonuses. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_aura_crit_chance_aura.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Beneficiaries, affected stat and additive magnitude agree. |
| Percentage points, caps and damage distinction | No stack cap, chance clamp, example or Critical Damage bonus stated; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_gunslinger_aura_description / a2000c1d` | Maximum 1 stack; chance clamps to 0–1. A 10% baseline becomes 15% rather than 10.5%; the effect increases chance, not Critical Damage. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_aura_crit_chance_aura.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These calculation/stack limits and the stat distinction supplement the English. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Effects, value and cooldown | Forward wave Staggers Enemies; `Quells 50% Peril`; `Base Cooldown: 30s`; augmented Psykinetic's Wrath; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_shout_vent_warp_charge_description / 7d4501be` | The improved shout immediately removes 0.5 from normalized Peril and uses a 30-second base cooldown; forward targets receive the shout effect. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_shout_vent_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated effects and base values agree; the Quell wording does not claim multiplication of current Peril. |
| Calculation, targeting and event order | No percentage-point examples, clamp, angle/range filter or event order stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_shout_vent_warp_charge_description / 7d4501be` | `current_percentage - 0.5` clamps to 0–1; 80% becomes 30%, 40% becomes 0%. Direction, angle and range filter targets, with a nearby exception; `on_combat_ability` precedes Quell. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_shout_vent_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These calculation and execution details supplement the English. |

[Fixed source and line references](psyker_combat_ability_stance.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated effects and magnitudes agree with the accepted fields. |
| State, growth, end and lingering effect | Entering/leaving Gaze; +1% Damage each second up to +30%, lingering 10s; Kills slow Peril build-up; ends at 100%; base cooldown 25s; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_combat_ability_overcharge_stance_improved_description / 00d42220` | Gaze is a character state; damage grows to +30% and stacks determine a 10-second exit buff. Kills offset the rising Peril rate; 100% stops the active buff. Base cooldown is 25 seconds. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_combat_ability_stance.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | State wording, growth, duration and end condition agree. The Chinese area wording is not an English error. |
| Calculation and additional limits | No full damage formula, maximum-Toughness basis, cooldown pause, Precognition bonus-stack condition or guaranteed duration stated; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_combat_ability_overcharge_stance_improved_description / 00d42220` | Extra Weakspot damage receives +10%; full-stack general damage is +40%. Recovery uses maximum Toughness, chance adds percentage points; Precognition enables bonus_stacks. Cooldown pauses during Gaze; duration depends on Peril and other factors. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_combat_ability_stance.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These calculations and conditions supplement the stated effects. |

Finesse field is 0.01 per stack, maximum 30, with a 10-second exit buff. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_overcharge_weakspot_kill_bonuses.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Credited progress and the stated Finesse values/duration agree; counting time already spent does not promise longer active duration. |

The existing example uses normal recovery of 1 second per second. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_2_tier_3_name_2.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The trigger and duration agree; 0.5 extra resource relative to the example's normal one-second recovery corresponds to 50% regeneration. No Ally benefit is claimed. |

Normal updates give 3 × 0.5 = 1.5 extra seconds; the third tick runs before removal. A single if handles at most one tick per update, so delayed updates do not catch up multiple ticks.

[Fixed source and line references](psyker_overcharge_reduced_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The wording concerns new generation and agrees with the active-state reduction; it does not claim direct removal of accumulated Peril. |
| Quelling percentage basis and calculation limits | `increases Quellling by +30%` does not specify a rate-per-second basis or interval/duration formula; `ui / loc_ability_psyker_overcharge_reduced_warp_charge_vent_speed_description / 93f0b5f7` | vent_warp_charge_speed=0.7 multiplies vent_interval and vent_duration: 10 seconds becomes 7. For the same removal, 1/0.7≈1.429 gives about +42.9% rate. The effects do not linger with the exit damage buff. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_overcharge_reduced_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The 30% label is derived from shortened time.

[Fixed source and line references](psyker_passive_souls_from_elite_kills.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated triggers, values and effect directions match the accepted evidence. |
| Timer and resource details | Does not specify shared timer refresh, gradual decay, the Damage denominator or ability-resource overflow; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_souls_new_desc / 9ea525d4` | Stack events refresh the timer even at cap; expiry removes one and restarts it.

[Fixed source and line references](psyker_new_mark_passive.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated values, hit-dependent Damage bonuses and decay direction agree. |
| Meaning of the marking chance | Every second, enemies within 40m have a chance of being Marked; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_marked_enemies_passive_updated_desc / cfa752d8` | Selection requires an eligible living breed, horizontal view dot > 0.5 and line of sight; roughly one-second updates check visibility and reselection conditions rather than a marking probability. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_new_mark_passive.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | The English's 'chance' can be read as a random roll or as an opportunity subject to eligibility. The concrete wording/selection difference remains pending in-game comparison. |

Brain Rupture adds 0.5 Damage, Smite adds 2; empowered Assail skips throw-stock/Peril payment while its shot event still spends one empowerment stack. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_empowered_ability.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The values and cost effects agree. Blitz stock and empowerment are distinct resources; Assail still gains Damage, while its exact Base Damage display values remain unresolved. |

[Fixed source and line references](psyker_empowered_ability.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Explicit contradiction | The English explicitly halves cast time; the accepted execution formula does not. This is a fixed text/source difference, pending in-game comparison. |
| Smite spread speed | 50% faster spread between enemies; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_empowered_ability_description / 8b4a7ea9` | Although a 0.5 jump-time modifier is declared, quick-cast, charged and direct-target templates specify jump_time = 0.3; the accepted or expression chooses that interval and does not multiply it. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_empowered_ability.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Explicit contradiction | The English asserts faster spread, but the accepted path leaves this interval unchanged. Actual in-game behavior remains unobserved. |

Assail cleave 2→4; first-target distributions normal 225→350 and aimed 380→500, with other hit orders differing and shared Damage calculation still required.

| Additional versus total stacks | Weakspot Kills grant two additional stacks of Disrupt Destiny; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_mark_weakspot_stacks_description / 40c93869` | weakspot_stacks = 3 is the total grant; the display maps weakspot_stacks − 1 = 2 additional.

| Current target and cap | Does not restate current-Marked-target eligibility or the cap; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_mark_weakspot_stacks_description / 40c93869` | on_hit requires a personal kill of current_target and passes hit_weakspot to give_stack; unmarked kills do not qualify. Four→seven; 14 at cap 15→15. all_weakspot_kills_grant_buff is an internal name, not broader eligibility.

| Opposite damage groups and stacks | Non-Warp Kill grants +5% to Warp Attacks; Warp Kill grants +5% to non-Warp Attacks; each lasts 10s and stacks 5 times; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_kills_stack_other_weapon_damage_both_description / ef213cd8` | The corresponding Buff grants the stated bonus to the opposite damage group, with each template capped at 5 stacks for 10s. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_kills_stack_other_weapon_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | Both directions, quantities, durations and caps agree. |
| Classification and damage-stage implementation | No held-weapon test, timer-refresh rule or damage-stage formula; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_kills_stack_other_weapon_damage_both_description / ef213cd8` | Kill damage_type membership in warp_damage_types chooses the Buff; timers are separate and refresh per group; +0.05 damage and −0.05 warp_damage cancel for Warp Attacks. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_kills_stack_other_weapon_damage.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These implementation details explain the stated attack categories without changing them. |

## One with the Warp

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_warp_charge_reduces_toughness_damage_taken.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `96a29f5e`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_toughness_damage_reduction_from_warp_charge_desc / 96e4cb7c`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Range, resource and damage scope | Toughness Damage Reduction of +10% to +33% based on current Peril; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_toughness_damage_reduction_from_warp_charge_desc / 96e4cb7c` | Current Peril weights the Toughness damage-taken multiplier between 0.9 and 0.67; the effect does not reduce Health Damage. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_warp_charge_reduces_toughness_damage_taken.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The endpoints, current resource and Toughness-only scope agree. |
| Interpolation and combination | No interpolation or combination formula; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_toughness_damage_reduction_from_warp_charge_desc / 96e4cb7c` | The multiplier is linearly interpolated and multiplies with other reductions in the same multiplicative stage. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_warp_charge_reduces_toughness_damage_taken.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The formula and example explain how the stated range is applied. |

## Anticipation

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_improved_dodge.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `3a1d92bc`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_improved_dodge_description / b7dff1d2`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Additional Effective Dodge | Increase Effective Dodges by 1; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_improved_dodge_description / b7dff1d2` | extra_consecutive_dodges = 1 adds to diminishing_return_start. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_improved_dodge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | “By” denotes an addition, consistent with the verified total of 3 + 1 = 4 in the existing example. |
| Protection timing | Time considered Dodging increased by +50%; no exact phase specified; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_improved_dodge_description / b7dff1d2` | dodge_linger_time_modifier = 0.5 scales the protection linger after the action; it does not extend the whole dodge action by 50%. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_improved_dodge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The amount agrees, but the English leaves the specific protected phase implicit. |

## Empathic Evasion

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_dodge_after_crits.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `390d90d6`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_dodge_after_crits_description / 654d056c`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger, duration and ranged scope | A Critical Hit makes you count as Dodging against Ranged Attacks for 1s; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_dodge_after_crits_description / 654d056c` | The critical-hit proc enables count_as_dodge_vs_ranged for an active_duration of 1. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_dodge_after_crits.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The stated event, duration and Dodge scope agree. |
| Refresh and attack-specific limits | No refresh rule or list of attacks using dodge checks; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_dodge_after_crits_description / 654d056c` | Retriggering resets active time; only attacks using the ranged-dodge check are covered. Melee, explosions and ground fire do not acquire universal immunity. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_dodge_after_crits.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These limits clarify the Dodge keyword and are not an explicit English promise of invulnerability. |

## Solidity

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_increased_vent_speed.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `cab0da20`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_increased_vent_speed_description / 479e9713`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quell Speed percentage | Increases Quell Speed by 30%; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_increased_vent_speed_description / 479e9713` | Time and interval multiply by 0.7; the per-tick amount is unchanged, so the processing-rate multiplier is 1 / 0.7 ≈ 1.429. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_increased_vent_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Explicit contradiction | A 30% time reduction gives approximately 42.9% more processing per second; the English labels 30% as a speed increase. |
| Animation and scheduling limits | No animation or update-frame qualification; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_increased_vent_speed_description / 479e9713` | The existing 4s→2.8s example excludes entry/exit animations and is subject to discrete scheduling error. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_increased_vent_speed.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These limits qualify the static example and do not resolve the speed-versus-time percentage mismatch. |

## Warp Rider

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](psyker_damage_based_on_warp_charge.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `02e8b371`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_psyker_damage_based_on_warp_charge_desc / bfd23655`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Peril scaling and maximum bonus | Up to +20% Damage, increasing as Peril increases; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_damage_based_on_warp_charge_desc / bfd23655` | The actual damage stat interpolates from 0 to 0.2 using current_percentage. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_damage_based_on_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The maximum bonus and resource direction agree; the old development name is not localized text. |
| Interpolation and additive stage | No zero endpoint, interpolation rule or combination formula; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_damage_based_on_warp_charge_desc / bfd23655` | At 50% Peril the bonus is 10%; it adds to other bonuses in the same stage, as in the existing 125→135 example. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_damage_based_on_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The formula and examples supplement the broad scaling description. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Threshold, reward and attack limit | 5 Weakspot Hits grant the next Ranged Attack a guaranteed Critical; once per Attack; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_weakspot_grants_crit_once_description / 2341fb06` | Five eligible stacks activate guaranteed_ranged_critical_strike; duplicate attack_instigator_unit events and non-projectile later targets are restricted. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_guaranteed_crit_on_multiple_weakspot_hits.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The threshold, ranged reward and restriction on repeated attack triggers agree. |
| Eligibility, consumption and weapon limits | No damage floor, countdown, consumption event or critical-damage formula; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_weakspot_grants_crit_once_description / 2341fb06` | Zero-damage hits are excluded; a ranged on_critical_strike finishes the active effect without a normal duration timer. Critical sequence and Damage depend on the weapon and target. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_guaranteed_crit_on_multiple_weakspot_hits.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | These details explain valid accumulation and consumption without promising a single bullet or fixed doubling. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bonus versus final radius wording | 75% Radius for your Coherency Aura; no increase verb or plus sign; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_coherency_size_increase_description / 5556945e` | The 0.75 additive modifier has base 1, giving 1.75 times radius. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_coherency_aura_size_increase.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Cannot confirm | The terse English does not explicitly identify 75% as either a bonus or the resulting total; an English numerical contradiction is not established. |
| Radius formula and area | Radius is specified; no combination or area formula; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_coherency_size_increase_description / 5556945e` | current_radius uses radius × modifier × multiplier; 8m becomes 14m with other modifiers unchanged, and flat-circle area scales by 1.75². [Fixed source and line references](psyker_coherency_aura_size_increase.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The verified radius calculation and existing geometric example supplement the wording. |

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Block conversion and displayed parameter | Below critical Peril, Blocking generates Peril instead of Stamina loss; 25% of the blocked attack's Stamina cost; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_block_costs_warp_charge_desc / 136ee48b` | The accepted Block formula converts normalized Stamina cost using warp_charge_block_cost = 0.25. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_block_costs_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The resource conversion and mapped parameter agree. |
| Cap, normalization and overflow | No numerical threshold, maximum-Stamina denominator or overflow rule; `ui / loc_talent_psyker_block_costs_warp_charge_desc / 136ee48b` | Peril caps at 0.97; cost is normalized by max_stamina and modified by warp_charge_amount. Excess converts back without dividing by warp_charge_amount. [Fixed source and line references](psyker_block_costs_warp_charge.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The exact formulas explain how a Block can use Peril and then Stamina when the cap is reached. |

## Toughness Boost

Full raw template and formatting: [source evidence](base_toughness_node_buff_medium_5.md#original-english-template-and-reconstruction). Name hash `65a72c01`. Every row uses `ui / loc_talent_toughness_boost_medium_desc / 329702b6`.

| Rule | Original game English and resource / key / hash | Code behavior and fixed source / method / lines | Result | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flat Toughness bonus | +15 Toughness; `ui / loc_talent_toughness_boost_medium_desc / 329702b6` | The accepted node adds 15 flat maximum Toughness. [Fixed source and line references](base_toughness_node_buff_medium_5.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Consistent | The mapped number matches the verified flat bonus; it is not a percentage. |
| Maximum capacity and modifier order | No maximum/current distinction, recovery effect or modifier formula; `ui / loc_talent_toughness_boost_medium_desc / 329702b6` | Maximum Toughness adds flat toughness first, then multiplies by toughness_bonus and rounds up. [Fixed source and line references](base_toughness_node_buff_medium_5.md#fixed-source-evidence) | Not covered by the description | The capacity basis, combination order and absence of sustained restoration are supplementary explanations. |

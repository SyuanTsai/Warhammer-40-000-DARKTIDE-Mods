### Blackout

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd2156cb-6e65-4214-bd01-ab0b28665714" width="72" height="72" alt="Blackout talent icon">

- **Control area:** a quick-use grenade with a 3.5-metre explosion radius; Stagger Power is higher within 2.25 metres. The explosion itself deals no Health Damage and mainly interrupts and knocks back enemies.

- **Replenishment:** carry up to 5 grenades. Below capacity, every 20 kills within 12.5 metres restore one grenade; both Melee and Ranged kills count. At full capacity, kills do not advance the counter.

- **Replenishment example:** with 2 grenades and 19 tracked kills, the next kill within range raises the count to 3 grenades and resets progress to zero. Extra Pouches increases capacity to 5 + 1 = 6 grenades.

- **Needle Pistol exception:** an enemy previously hit and tracked by the Needle Pistol can also count if it dies to Toxin at Close Range. Other deaths caused by ranged-applied Toxin cannot automatically use this exception.

#### Traditional Chinese description erratum

- The original Traditional Chinese says Melee kills where it should say kills at Close Range. Ranged kills within 12.5 metres also advance grenade replenishment.

### Boom Bringer

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b4df232-3b49-4f84-98c0-2b3e8828f917" width="72" height="72" alt="Boom Bringer talent icon">

- **Attack:** missile direct-impact and explosion Damage are calculated separately. The explosion has a 4-metre inner radius and a 7-metre overall radius; outer-area Damage is lower and falls off with distance.

- **Damage example:** for an unmodified inner explosion with no falloff, base Damage is 20 × (500 × 2800 ÷ 10000) = 2800. An Unarmoured hit location uses ×1.25 for 3500; a Carapace location uses ×2.4 for 6720. These numbers exclude direct missile impact, hit-location modifiers, enemy-specific Damage reduction and other talents.

- **Ammunition:** carry up to 2 missiles, increased to 3 by Extra Pouches. Replacing the original Stagger grenade removes replenishment from every 20 kills at Close Range.

### Chem Grenade

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d3c5999-8823-4b54-9204-6e22637bc851" width="72" height="72" alt="Chem Grenade talent icon">

- **Toxic area:** the explosion leaves toxic matter for 15 seconds. Its shape spreads along the terrain. Enemies standing in it receive one stack of the same Toxin every 0.35 seconds, up to 6 stacks supplied by the area.

- **Toxin example:** at 6 stacks, each Damage calculation uses input Power 500 × 6 ÷ 30 = 100, then applies the Toxin curve and armour calculation. Other sources can raise the same Toxin to higher stacks; 6 is not a universal maximum for all Toxin.

- **Additional effects:** toxic matter makes enemies easier to Cleave through in Melee and marks them for a death explosion. The mark lasts 12 seconds; death while it remains active causes an explosion with a 2.5-metre radius. An enemy can therefore explode after leaving the area.

- **Ammunition:** carry up to 2 grenades, increased to 3 by Extra Pouches. The original Stagger grenade's close-kill replenishment is removed.

### Gunslinger Improved

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3927d1d0-9e15-4b96-9a91-00f0503e338c" width="72" height="72" alt="Gunslinger Improved talent icon">

- **Sharing:** when you or an ally with this Aura collect Ammo, the pickup is shared with members in that collector's Coherency. Each member uses their own weapon capacity; the collector's received rounds are not divided among the team.

- **Small Ammo example:** a small pickup normally replenishes 15% of reserve capacity. Each member receives their reserve maximum × 15% × 10%, rounded up. A reserve maximum of 200 gives 3 rounds; a maximum of 100 gives ⌈1.5⌉ = 2 rounds.

- **Large Ammo and Ammo Crates:** a large pickup normally replenishes 50%; at a reserve maximum of 200, sharing gives 10 rounds. A normal deployed Ammo Crate uses 10% of (reserve maximum + magazine capacity): 200 + 30 gives 23 rounds, still capped by the actual missing amount.

- **Duplicate limits:** multiple players with the same Aura do not provide multiple copies. This improved version's 10% replaces the base version's 5%. Shared Ammo cannot trigger another chain of sharing.

- **Recipients:** you and allies in Coherency gain 10% Melee Damage. Only one copy of the same Aura applies.

- **Damage example:** base Melee Damage of 100 becomes 110. With another 25% bonus in the same stage, 100 × (1 + 25% + 10%) = 135.

- **Recipients:** you and allies in Coherency gain additional Critical Chance. The same Aura does not apply multiple times.

- **Chance example:** an initial 10% becomes 10% + 5% = 15%; an initial 25% becomes 30%.

### Enhanced Desperado

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/785f7b2c-0591-4cc4-b928-31c26b07d0f7" width="72" height="72" alt="Enhanced Desperado talent icon">

- **Activation and protection:** immediately swap to your Ranged Weapon, fill the magazine and enter focus for 10 seconds. During focus, you count as Dodging Ranged Attacks, Sprint without Stamina cost and are immune to Suppression.

- **Sprint example:** Sprint Speed increases by 20%; an initial 5 metres/second becomes 5 × 1.2 = 6 metres/second.

- **Highlighting and extension:** highlight eligible enemies within 12.5 metres. Ranged kills at Close Range extend focus, initially by 1 second each; after 20 seconds from activation this falls to 0.2 seconds per kill, and after 40 seconds to 0.04 seconds. Each extension can restore remaining duration to at most 10 seconds.

- **Needle Pistol Toxin exception:** an enemy hit with a Ranged Needle Pistol attack and tracked during focus may extend the state even when Toxin Damage delivers the killing blow; it must also die at Close Range. Other Toxin kills do not automatically trigger this.

- **Ammo and cooldown:** reloading during focus does not consume reserve Ammo. Natural replenishment for the base 45-second cooldown starts only after focus ends; extending focus delays that start. At the end, the magazine is recalculated against remaining reserve Ammo, so a whole magazine of free rounds from the state is not retained.

- **Deployment and range:** place a refitted Medi-Pack on the ground to form a gas field with a 3-metre radius, lasting 20 seconds by default. You and allies breathing the gas gain its effects.

- **Corruption healing:** remove up to 0.5 Corruption every 0.25 seconds. The displayed total is at most 20 ÷ 0.25 × 0.5 = 40; Corruption taken is zero while the field effect applies. It cannot clear Corruption that has consumed a complete Health segment. Leaving the field removes the base effect.

- **Stimm sharing:** if you carry a Stimm, the field gives its corresponding effects to allies in range. Deployment consumes or removes the corresponding Stimm use.

- **Cooldown:** base cooldown 60 seconds. Natural replenishment pauses while the field operates and starts after it ends.

### Rampage!

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8bc68a-7d1b-4ee7-8691-bed95ed8069d" width="72" height="72" alt="Rampage! talent icon">

- **Activation:** replenish all Toughness, swap to your Melee Weapon and enter rage for a base 10 seconds.

- **Melee Power and Attack Speed:** gain additive +35% Melee Power Level and +20% Melee Attack Speed. Power Level affects attack output and impact, and cannot be treated as an equal percentage of final Damage. With only +20% Attack Speed, an initial 1-second action takes approximately 1 ÷ 1.20 = 0.83 seconds. For example, Power 500 becomes 500 × 1.35 = 675 before the weapon's Damage and Stagger curves.

- **Damage taken:** multiply Damage taken by 0.75. With only this effect, 100 incoming Damage becomes 100 × 0.75 = 75, a 25% reduction.

- **Duration extension:** each Melee hit initially extends rage by 0.3 seconds. For every 20 seconds elapsed since activation, the per-hit extension halves: 0.15 seconds during seconds 20–40 and 0.075 seconds during seconds 40–60. This diminishes individual extensions; it does not impose a total 20-second duration cap.

- **Immunity and cooldown:** rage grants Stun and Slowdown immunity. Natural replenishment for the base 30-second cooldown begins after rage ends.

### Pulverising Strikes

- **Cleave example:** during rage, Damage and Stagger Cleave capacities each increase by 50%; an initial capacity of 10 becomes 15. Actual enemies Cleaved still depend on enemy mass and weapon limits.

- **Gradually increasing Power:** gain one Melee Power stack for approximately every second rage persists. Each grants +2.5%, up to 10 stacks for a maximum +25%.

- **Combined with rage:** if you have rage's own +35% Melee Power Level, counting only these effects at the stack cap gives 35% + (10 × 2.5%) = 60% Power Level modifier. This is not +60% final Damage. For example, Power 500 becomes 500 × 1.6 = 800.

- **Eligible attacks:** while rage is active, Melee Heavy Attacks gain +25% Rending.

- **Reading the effect:** Rending affects the armour-penetration calculation. It does not multiply Damage by 1.25 and does not apply to Light or Ranged Attacks.

- **Armour example:** assume an original armour Damage multiplier of 0.5 and armour that fully accepts this Rending. The multiplier becomes 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75; the same 100 pre-armour Damage changes from 50 to 75. Different armour and existing weapon penetration change the actual increase.

### Forge's Bellow

- **Trigger:** Shout once when rage starts; when rage ends, Shout again if you are still alive.

- **Range and Stagger:** each Shout has a 4.5-metre radius and Staggers enemies in range.

- **Enemy slowdown:** each Shout reduces affected enemies' Melee Attack Speed by 50% for 5 seconds. If the original interval is 1 second, half speed gives approximately 1 ÷ 0.5 = 2 seconds between attacks, an increase of 100%, not 50%. This statistic does not modify Ranged Attack Speed.

#### English description erratum

- English says the time between attacks increases by +50%. The verified modifier halves Melee Attack Speed; with this effect alone, the reciprocal interval doubles, increasing by 100%.

- **Special-enemy extension:** Melee hits on Elites, Specialists, Monstrosities or Captain-type enemies extend rage by 1 second. This type of hit begins diminishing only after 30 seconds: 0.5 seconds per hit after 30 seconds and 0.25 seconds after 60 seconds.

- **Ordinary-enemy extension:** ordinary enemy hits retain the base 0.3-second extension and start diminishing after 20 seconds. The 30-second threshold does not also change ordinary hits.

### Focused Resolve

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d4304b-23f7-4666-879b-62c727596b69" width="72" height="72" alt="Focused Resolve talent icon">

- **Cooldown restored:** during focus, ordinary Close Range Ranged kills restore 0.5 seconds of Ability Cooldown. Elite and Specialist kills restore 1 second.

- **Per-activation cap:** each focus state restores at most 5 seconds: 10 ordinary kills or 5 Elite/Specialist kills reach the cap, and mixed kills stop restoring once their combined total reaches 5 seconds.

- **Cooldown example:** natural recovery is 1 second per second and the base cooldown is 45 seconds. Restoring the full 5 seconds leaves 45 − 5 = 40 seconds of natural recovery after focus ends. Natural recovery pauses during focus, but kill-triggered restoration still adds resource directly.

- **Needle Pistol exception:** a target tracked after a Needle Pistol hit during focus can also restore cooldown if it subsequently dies from Toxin within Close Range. This does not make every Toxin death eligible.

- **Ranged Rending:** while focus is active, Ranged Attacks gain +15% Rending in armour penetration. This is not a direct 15% Damage increase.

- **Damage stacks:** each eligible Close Range Ranged kill adds one stack of +3% Ranged Damage, up to 5 stacks. A new kill refreshes the duration. After kills stop, one stack expires every 3 seconds; ending focus removes all remaining stacks.

- **Eligibility:** ordinary kills must occur within 12.5 m. A previously tracked enemy hit by the Needle Pistol can also trigger the effect if it later dies from Toxin within Close Range.

- **Damage example:** with only this effect and 5 stacks, base Damage 100 becomes 100 × (1 + 5 × 0.03) = 115. Other Ranged Damage bonuses add to the same pool.

### Practiced Deployment

- **Trigger:** newly acquiring a usable Stimm, or restoring one dedicated Stimm charge, fills one Stimm Supply ability charge.

- **Charge cap:** this ability has at most 1 charge. If it is already ready, the trigger cannot store an extra charge. A Stimm already in its slot when the talent is acquired does not immediately trigger restoration; availability must increase later.

- **Timing example:** if 40 seconds of cooldown remain when the effect triggers, the ability becomes usable again. The polling check applies the effect within approximately half a second.

### Fast Acting Stimms

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ea2874c-338f-42ec-95cb-9f4c08e64794" width="72" height="72" alt="Fast Acting Stimms talent icon">

- **Field duration:** the field itself lasts only 5 seconds. After leaving its area, effects already received can continue for 15 seconds. If you stay until the field ends, those effects can last up to a further 15 seconds after it disappears.

- **Healing and Stimm effects:** the effects retained include Corruption healing and immunity, together with the Stimm effects shared by that deployment.

- **Cooldown:** the 60-second natural cooldown starts when the field ends, even while some allies' effects may linger for 15 seconds. Counting only this ability's duration and recovery, deployment to the next natural charge takes approximately 5 + 60 = 65 seconds.

### Booby Trap

- **Trigger:** the field explodes when its duration ends. The base field ends after 20 seconds; if a duration-shortening effect also applies, the explosion occurs at the end of the actual field duration.

- **Explosion effect:** enemies hit and damaged by the 3-metre frag explosion receive 7 Toxin stacks. This is one explosion, rather than 7 stacks applied on every field pulse.

- **Cooldown:** the 60-second natural cooldown resumes after the field ends and explodes. The explosion itself does not extend the cooldown pause.

- **Damage example:** excluding other bonuses and special Damage Reduction, an Unarmoured target within 0.5 metres of the centre takes 20 × 500 × 300 ÷ 10000 = 300 explosion Damage. With the corresponding armour multiplier of 0.25, this becomes 300 × 0.25 = 75. Subsequent Toxin Damage is calculated separately.

- **Dodge speed:** Dodge movement speed increases by 25%. A speed of 4 metres per second at the same point in the motion becomes 4 × 1.25 = 5 metres per second. Actual action duration is still calculated across the full speed curve.

- **Dodging checks:** after the Dodge ends, Melee and grab attacks continue considering you to be Dodging for 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.40 seconds, extended from 0.25 seconds. Ranged checks gain a 0.15-second window. Whether an attack misses still depends on its own checking rules.

- **Scope:** the bonus changes movement speed during a Dodge and the attack system's Dodging checks. It does not increase the number of consecutive Dodges or their cooldown-recovery speed.

### Adrenaline Frenzy

- **Trigger:** each Melee hit grants 1 stack. A Critical hit adds another 1, for 1 + 1 = 2 stacks from one Critical Melee hit.

- **Stacks and decay:** the maximum is 30 stacks. Each stack gain resets the 2-second timer. If no further stack is gained, one stack is removed and the timer restarts from that removal; another stack then expires every 2 seconds.

- **At the cap:** the 30th stack triggers Frenzy and clears the Adrenaline stack buff. Frenzy lasts 10 seconds, and retriggering restarts its timer.

- **Frenzy speed:** the additive Melee Attack Speed multiplier changes from 1 to 1.10. An affected action originally taking 1 second takes approximately 1 ÷ 1.10 = 0.91 seconds.

- **Frenzy Damage:** +25% Melee Damage is additive Damage modification. With only this effect, base Damage 100 becomes 125.

### Vulture's Mark

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc42ba2-04c8-4a98-ae3e-5341b777ccdd" width="72" height="72" alt="Vulture's Mark talent icon">

- **Gaining Marks:** kill an Elite or Specialist with a Ranged attack to gain 1 stack for 8 seconds. Another gain adds a stack and resets the shared timer, up to 3 stacks. Without another gain, all Marks disappear 8 seconds after the last gain.

- **Per-stack bonuses:** each stack adds 5% Ranged Damage, 5 percentage points of Ranged Critical Chance and 5% Movement Speed. At 3 stacks these are +15%, +15 percentage points and +15%, respectively.

- **Toughness at the cap:** while at 3 stacks, each further Ranged Elite or Specialist kill restores 15% of maximum Toughness to you and Allies in Coherency, limited by each recipient's missing Toughness.

- **Weapon exception:** a Close Range Needle Pistol Toxin kill can grant a Mark. First hit an Elite/Specialist with a Needle Pistol in the Ranged weapon slot; while its Toxin effect remains active, that target must die from Toxin within Close Range.

- **Damage example:** with no other modifiers, base Ranged Damage 100 at 3 stacks becomes 100 × (1 + 3 × 0.05) = 115. With another 20% at the same stage, it becomes 100 × (1 + 0.20 + 0.15) = 135.

- **Toughness example:** with maximum Toughness 100 and at least 15 missing, a qualifying Ranged Elite/Specialist kill at maximum stacks restores 100 × 0.15 = 15.

### Chemical Dependency

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b42d72f-2429-446a-bf75-d5d87db98b36" width="72" height="72" alt="Chemical Dependency talent icon">

- **Trigger:** each Stimm use grants 1 stack. First receiving the effects of a Stimm-containing Stimm Supply field also triggers it.

- **Stacks:** the maximum is 3. Each adds 10% to the Combat Ability resource-recovery multiplier. At 3 stacks this is 1 + 3 × 0.10 = 1.30, or 30% faster recovery than the base rate.

- **Timing:** the base duration is 90 seconds. A new stack resets the shared timer. After 90 seconds without another gain, one stack is lost and the timer restarts; subsequent stacks then expire one at a time every 90 seconds.

- **Recovery example:** if the same Combat Ability resource amount normally takes 60 seconds to recover, with uninterrupted recovery and no other modifiers, 3 stacks take approximately 60 ÷ 1.30 = 46.15 seconds.

- **Per-stack bonus:** each stack adds 5 percentage points of general Critical Chance, included in both Melee and Ranged Critical Chance calculations.

- **Maximum-stack example:** Scum's base Critical Chance is 10%. At 3 stacks, 3 × 5% adds 15 percentage points, giving 10% + 15% = 25% before extra weapon chance.

- **Critical effect:** this upgrade increases Critical Chance, rather than Critical Damage. Dependency still decays one stack every 90 seconds under the core rules; Stimm use refreshes the timer.

- **Stimm use:** each use restores 50% of maximum Toughness. With maximum Toughness 100 and at least 50 missing, it restores 50; with only 20 missing, it restores at most 20.

- **Per-stack reduction:** each stack multiplies Toughness Damage Taken by 0.95. At 3 stacks, 0.95³ = 0.8574 of the original Damage is taken, approximately 14.26% less Toughness Damage.

- **At the cap:** even when Dependency is already at maximum stacks, another Stimm use can restore Toughness and refresh the stack timer.

- **Duration and cap:** the stack timer becomes 60 seconds and the maximum becomes 4 stacks. Compared with the core, each timer is 30 seconds shorter and one additional stack is allowed.

- **Recovery:** the core's +10% Combat Ability resource recovery per stack still applies. At 4 stacks the multiplier is 1 + 4 × 0.10 = 1.40. Uninterrupted recovery that originally takes 60 seconds becomes 60 ÷ 1.40 ≈ 42.86 seconds.

- **Refresh and decay:** another Stimm use resets the shared timer. Without another gain, one stack expires after 60 seconds, then another every 60 seconds. A use at 4 stacks cannot add a fifth, but still refreshes the timer.

- **Trigger:** a Ranged Elite or Specialist kill triggers the effect. Existing Vulture's Mark stacks are not required.

- **Area and effect:** it pushes enemies around you within 3 metres through Stagger, dealing no direct Damage.

- **Target differences:** whether an enemy is actually moved depends on Stagger resistance, armour and its current state. It cannot guarantee interrupting every enemy's action.

- **Duration:** after gaining a Vulture's Mark, the stacks' shared timer is 12 seconds, 4 seconds longer than the core's 8.

- **Refresh:** a new Mark adds a stack and resets the shared timer to 12 seconds. At the 3-stack cap, another qualifying event still refreshes the timer.

- **Expiry:** without another Mark, existing stacks disappear together when the 12-second timer expires.

- **Timing example:** gain the first stack at 0 seconds and a second at 6 seconds. The second gain restarts 12 seconds; without further gains, the current stacks expire at 18 seconds.

- **Trigger:** a Ranged Critical hit triggers the effect. An ordinary Ranged hit or a Critical Melee hit does not.

- **Effect:** for 1 second, you count as Dodging against Melee and Ranged attacks even without pressing Dodge. The result still follows each attack's Dodge rules; this does not make all Damage ineffective.

- **Refresh:** another Ranged Critical hit within that second restarts the 1-second timer, without accumulating multiple stacks.

- **Scope:** this directly changes Dodging checks. It does not increase actual Dodge distance or movement speed and does not require a Dodge action.

- **Timing example:** trigger at 0 seconds, then land another Ranged Critical hit at 0.6 seconds; the effect continues until 1.6 seconds.

- **Weakspot hits:** a Weakspot Melee hit gives the original 1 stack plus 2 additional stacks, for 3 total.

- **Ordinary hits:** a non-Weakspot Melee hit gives no regular stack. The Critical check still runs independently, so a non-Weakspot Critical Melee hit still grants 1 additional stack.

- **Critical Weakspot hit:** the Weakspot hit's 3 stacks plus the additional Critical stack give 4 total, still subject to the core 30-stack cap and stack-timing rules.

- **Duration:** triggered Frenzy lasts 20 seconds, 10 seconds longer than the core's 10.

- **Refresh:** reaching 30 stacks again retriggers the same single Frenzy effect and resets its duration to 20 seconds.

- **Other rules:** this upgrade leaves Adrenaline's 2-second stack timer, 30-stack cap, and Frenzy's Attack Speed and Damage multipliers unchanged.

- **Recovery amount**: restore 5% of maximum Toughness each second. At 100 maximum Toughness, each tick restores 100 × 0.05 = 5 points.
- **Recovery cap**: recovery cannot exceed the current Toughness deficit. A tick adds no Toughness when Toughness is already full.
- **Timing**: recovery occurs only during Adrenaline Frenzy. The first tick can occur immediately when Frenzy begins, followed by 1-second intervals.

- **Trigger**: an ordinary Melee kill grants the core's 1 hit stack plus this upgrade's 4 stacks, for 5 total. A Critical Melee kill also grants the core's Critical stack, for 6 total.
- **Elite kills**: killing an Elite grants another 10 stacks, giving 15 for an ordinary Elite kill or 16 for a Critical Elite kill.
- **Non-killing hits**: a Melee attack that does not kill its target grants no stacks. Even a Critical non-killing hit does not trigger the core's additional Critical stack.
- **Elite check**: the extra 10 stacks depend on the Elite classification. An enemy classified only as a Specialist does not qualify for this Elite bonus.

- **Trigger and duration**: after a Successful Dodge, Damage within 12.5 metres increases by 15% for 3 seconds. Retriggering resets the duration without stacking the amount.
- **Distance example**: the bonus falls off beyond 12.5 metres and reaches zero at 30 metres. At 16.875 metres, the interpolation factor is √((16.875 − 12.5) ÷ 17.5) = 0.5, leaving 15% × (1 − 0.5) = 7.5%; base Damage of 100 becomes 107.5.
- **Close-range example**: with this effect alone, base Damage of 100 becomes 115. With an existing 25% Damage bonus at the same stage, the result is 100 × (1 + 25% + 15%) = 140.

- **Recovery amount**: ordinary Melee hits restore 4% of maximum Toughness; Critical or Weakspot hits instead restore 8%, and hits that are both Critical and on a Weakspot restore 12%. A kill is not required. Direct instakills from special executions do not trigger this effect.
- **Same swing**: a later target triggers recovery again only when its recovery percentage exceeds the percentage already recorded for this attack. Equal percentages do not repeat recovery for every target.
- **Recovery example**: with 100 maximum Toughness, hitting an ordinary target and then a Weakspot restores 4 points followed by 8, for 12 total. A subsequent Critical Weakspot hit in the same attack can restore another 12 points. Each recovery is capped by the deficit; if only 5 points are missing, it restores at most 5.

- **Needle Pistol**: first hit a living Enemy with the Needle Pistol. If that Enemy remains tracked by the Toxin logic and dies to Toxin at close range, the bonus can also trigger.

- **How it adds**: increase maximum Toughness by 25 points. This adds to other fixed Toughness bonuses before applying percentage modifiers to maximum Toughness.

- **Recovery**: each Successful Dodge restores 10% of maximum Stamina, without exceeding the Stamina cap.
- **Recovery example**: at 5 maximum Stamina, each trigger restores 5 × 10% = 0.5 points. At 4.8 current Stamina, it restores only 0.2 points.

- **How it works**: while sliding, you have Melee Dodge status, so Enemy Melee attacks follow their Dodge rules. This does not directly make you immune to all Damage.
- **Trigger limit**: starting a slide does not mean an attack has already been successfully Dodged. You must actually avoid an attack that qualifies for the check to trigger talents tied to a Successful Dodge.

- **Trigger condition**: taking Ranged Damage while your Toughness is not depleted starts ongoing Toughness recovery. Restore 10% of maximum Toughness per second for 3 seconds.
- **Refresh and cancellation**: retriggering resets the 3-second duration without stacking the recovery rate. Recovery stops when Toughness is depleted.
- **Recovery example**: at 100 maximum Toughness, restore 10 points per second, totalling 30 over a full 3 seconds. If triggered again at the 2-second mark, recovery can extend to the 5-second mark, totalling at most 50 points, still capped by the deficit.

### Unload

- **How it works**: when a reload refills ammunition, gain a 7-second Damage effect. It starts at 2% Ranged Damage and adds another 2% for every accumulated amount of ammunition spent equal to 10% of magazine capacity. Incomplete stages do not count.
- **Reloading again**: another reload resets the duration and ammunition-spent counter, restarting accumulation from 2%.
- **Damage example**: with a 100-round magazine and 30 rounds spent during the effect, the bonus is 2% + ⌊30 ÷ 10⌋ × 2% = 8%. Base Damage of 100 becomes 108; with an existing 25% bonus at the same stage, it becomes 100 × (1 + 25% + 8%) = 133.
- **Cap explanation**: spending the equivalent of one full magazine gives 22%. Ammunition replenishment that does not reset this effect can allow continued accumulation, so 22% is not a fixed cap.

- **Speed bonus**: use your remaining current Stamina. Each whole point grants 2% Melee Attack Speed; the bonus decreases as Stamina falls.
- **Timing example**: 5.8 current Stamina counts as 5 points, granting 10% Attack Speed. An accelerable action normally taking 1 second becomes 1 ÷ 1.1 ≈ 0.91 seconds, rather than a direct 10% time reduction to 0.9 seconds.
- **Cap**: at most 30 points of current Stamina count, giving 60% Attack Speed. Your actual attainable bonus is still limited by your maximum Stamina.

- **Gain and removal**: a Melee Backstab adds 1 stack, granting 10% Melee Power per stack, up to 5. There is no fixed countdown. A Melee hit on a target from outside its back clears all stacks.
- **Power example**: 5 stacks grant 50%. If Power entering this bonus stage is 500, the result is 500 × 1.5 = 750. With another 20% Power bonus at the same stage, it is 500 × (1 + 20% + 50%) = 850.
- **Damage limit**: Power still passes through the weapon's Damage, Stagger, and Cleave curves. A 50% Power increase must not be described as 50% more final Damage for every weapon.

- **How it works**: while wielding a Ranged weapon, gain 1 additional consecutive Effective Dodge before diminishing returns begin. The bonus is not retained after switching to a Melee weapon.
- **Count example**: a weapon with 3 Effective Dodges becomes 3 + 1 = 4. This bonus does not increase Dodge Distance or Dodge Speed.

- **Recovery**: While your Stimm cooldown is recovering, each kill reduces it by 0.5s. Killing an enemy infected with Chem Toxin instead reduces it by 1s. The two amounts do not add together.

- **Cooldown example**: With 20s remaining, four ordinary kills remove 4 × 0.5 = 2s, leaving 18s; four kills of Chem Toxin infected enemies remove 4s, leaving 16s.

- **Limits**: This has no effect while Stimm recovery is paused. Once recovery is complete, excess recovery cannot be saved for the next use.

#### Traditional Chinese wording erratum

- The Chinese original places the toxin name in the enemy-count position, equivalent to “kill … enemies.” The actual condition is killing an enemy infected with Chem Toxin, which instead reduces cooldown by 1s per kill.

- **Condition**: At 75% of maximum Stamina or higher, the wait for the consecutive-Dodge count to recover is reduced by 40%. The bonus is lost below the threshold.

- **Timing example**: If stopping consecutive Dodges normally requires a 1-second wait, it becomes 1 × (1 − 40%) = 0.6s. With 4 maximum Stamina, retaining at least 4 × 75% = 3 points enables the bonus.

- **Behavior**: Increases the Power used for Toxin Damage; it does not increase Toxin stacks or duration.

- **Power example**: With Toxin input Power of 500, this effect alone gives 500 × 1.1 = 550, then the Toxin Damage curve and enemy armour determine Damage. Each Toxin tick cannot simply be treated as dealing a fixed 10% more Damage.

- **Swap example**: An accelerable swap action that normally takes 1s becomes 1 ÷ 1.4 ≈ 0.71s.

- **Firing control**: While firing from the hip or bracing, the Recoil modifier is ×0.9 and reticle Spread is ×0.7. Ordinary aiming without bracing does not gain these two bonuses.

- **Spread example**: With this effect alone, a 2-degree Spread angle becomes 2 × 0.7 = 1.4 degrees. The Recoil modifier affects unsteadiness accumulation and recovery; actual camera displacement also depends on weapon curves.

- **Duration**: Takes effect when reloading starts and lasts another 4s after leaving the reload state. Reloading again maintains the same reduction rather than adding another reduction.

- **Damage-reduction example**: An incoming 100 Toughness Damage becomes 100 × 0.75 = 75 with this effect alone. With another 20% Toughness Damage reduction at the same stage, it becomes 100 × (1 − 20% − 25%) = 55.

- **Scope**: Only reduces Damage taken by Toughness; it does not directly reduce Health Damage by 25% as well.

- **Trigger**: When you receive a Melee hit, it knocks back enemies within 3m and increases Movement Speed by 10% for 3s. Melee attacks from enemies that disable you do not trigger it.

- **Cooldown and example**: The cooldown is 8s after triggering. With this effect alone, Movement Speed of 5m/s becomes 5 × 1.1 = 5.5m/s.

- **Knockback limits**: The pulse itself deals no Damage. Whether it interrupts an enemy still depends on the enemy's Stagger resistance and state.

- **Calculation**: Each complete percentage point of current Critical Hit Chance grants 0.5% Melee Damage. At most 30 percentage points count, for a total of 15%. You do not need to land a Critical Hit first, and Critical Hit Chance is not consumed.

- **Damage example**: At 12.8% Critical Hit Chance, 12 steps count, giving 12 × 0.5% = 6% Damage. Base 100 becomes 106. With another 25% Damage bonus at the same stage, 100 × (1 + 25% + 6%) = 131.

- **Dynamic updates**: Changes to your weapon, temporary bonuses or Critical Hit Chance also update the Melee Damage bonus.

- **Stacks**: Each Melee kill adds one stack, granting 10% Damage Cleave capacity per stack, up to 5 stacks. Triggering again resets the 5s duration.

- **Cleave example**: Five stacks grant 50%. A starting capacity to pass through targets with total mass 10 becomes 10 × 1.5 = 15. The number of enemies hit still depends on each enemy's mass, armour and weapon limits.

- **Scope**: This increases Damage Cleave capacity. It does not mean each enemy takes 50% more Damage, and it does not directly increase Stagger Cleave capacity.

- **Behavior**: On killing an enemy, 25% of the Damage exceeding its remaining Health becomes flat bonus Melee Damage for 1s. Special instant executions do not trigger this.

- **Damage example**: Dealing 300 Damage to an enemy with 100 Health remaining gives 200 overkill Damage and 200 × 25% = 50 bonus Damage. If the next Melee attack would deal 100 at this calculation stage, it becomes 150. This is flat bonus Damage, not a 50% increase.

- **Another kill**: During the effect, the current bonus is subtracted before calculating the new 25%. Only a higher new value replaces the bonus and restarts its timer. With 50 bonus Damage already active and 400 overkill Damage on the next kill, the new value is (400 − 50) × 25% = 87.5. If overkill is only 200, the new value of 37.5 is lower, so it neither replaces the bonus nor restarts the timer.

- **Behavior**: When you add Chem Toxin to an enemy or increase its Toxin stacks, it takes 10% more Damage from all sources. Retriggering resets the 5s duration without stacking the magnitude.

- **Duration limit**: If Chem Toxin disappears early, the vulnerability also ends early; a full 5s duration is not guaranteed.

- **Damage example**: An initial 100 Damage becomes 110 with the vulnerability alone. With another 25% Damage bonus on the attacker, 100 × 1.25 × 1.1 = 137.5. If the target already has another 20% vulnerability at the same stage, that stage is 1 + 20% + 10% = ×1.3.

- **Calculation**: Each enemy infected with Chem Toxin within 12.5m grants 5% Damage, reaching the 15% cap at three enemies. You do not need to have applied the Toxin yourself. The bonus drops as enemies leave the area or lose Toxin.

- **Damage example**: Two infected enemies nearby grant 10% Damage, taking base 100 to 110. With another 25% bonus at the same stage, 100 × (1 + 25% + 10%) = 135.

- **Trigger**: Killing an Elite enemy with Melee spreads Chem Toxin within 4m of that enemy, selecting at most 10 enemies. The killed enemy does not need to have been infected already.

- **Stack limit**: This talent only fills this Toxin type up to 2 stacks. An initial 0 becomes 2, and 1 is filled to 2. At 2 or more, it only resets Toxin duration without adding further stacks.

- **Toxin example**: Damage occurs every 0.35s based on current Toxin stacks. At 2 stacks, input Power is 500 × 2 ÷ 30 ≈ 33.33, then the Toxin curve and armour determine Damage. This does not directly deal 33.33 Damage.

- **Stacks**: Each Melee Critical Hit adds one stack of the same Toxin type to that enemy and resets Toxin duration. It shares the 30-stack cap with other ways of applying the same Toxin.

- **Damage behavior**: Toxin resolves every 0.35s. At three stacks, input Power is 500 × 3 ÷ 30 = 50, then the Damage curve and enemy armour determine Damage. More stacks increase Power; Power cannot be treated directly as Damage.

- **Decay**: After you stop replenishing Toxin, the base 2.6s wait elapses, then stacks decay one at a time with Toxin Damage ticks. Applying Toxin again restarts the waiting period.

- **Stacks applied**: Blackout's explosion adds 3 stacks, Boom Bringer adds 6, and Chem Grenade adds 10. A Blitz explosion must hit the enemy; this does not apply to every explosion.

- **Stack example**: An enemy with 2 stacks of the same Toxin type hit by an explosion that adds 6 reaches 2 + 6 = 8 stacks. The cap is 30, and reapplication restarts the timer.

- **Damage behavior**: The same Toxin resolves every 0.35s. Eight stacks give input Power 500 × 8 ÷ 30 ≈ 133.33, then the Toxin curve and armour determine Damage.

- **Behavior**: After you apply Chem Toxin to an enemy, its Damage dealt is reduced by 15%; monsters and Captain-type bosses instead have a 30% reduction. When Toxin disappears, the reduction is removed too.

- **Damage-reduction example**: With this effect alone, an enemy that would deal 100 Damage deals 85; a boss eligible for the 30% reduction deals 70. This reduces the enemy's output, so teammates attacked by it also benefit.

- **Recovery**: For each enemy infected with Chem Toxin within 15m, restore 1% of maximum Toughness per second, counting at most 10 enemies. You do not need to have applied the Toxin yourself.

- **Recovery example**: At 100 maximum Toughness with four infected enemies nearby, restore 100 × 4 × 1% = 4 per second. At 10 or more enemies, the maximum is 10 per second. If only 3 Toughness is missing, only 3 is actually restored.

- **Damage bonus**: Deal 10% more damage while the enemy meets the Stagger condition. Medium or Heavy Stagger raises the total bonus to 15%; the 10% and 15% figures do not combine to 25%.

- **Damage example**: With a base of 100, Light Stagger gives 110, and Medium or Heavy Stagger gives 115. With another 25% bonus at the same stage, the latter becomes 100 × (1 + 25% + 15%) = 140.

- **Trigger**: After a Critical Melee Hit against a human-sized enemy, execute it if it is still alive and its remaining Health is strictly below the actual Damage dealt by that hit. Captain enemies are excluded.

- **Health threshold example**: An enemy starts with 190 Health and the Critical Hit deals 100, leaving 90. Since 90 < 100, it is executed. Starting with 200 leaves 100; 100 is not below 100, so execution does not trigger.

- **Meaning of twice the Damage**: Provided this hit actually removes the same amount of Health, the condition is equivalent to pre-hit Health below twice the Damage. It does not mean post-hit Health below twice the Damage.

- **Targets**: A target with the Elite or Monster classification receives the corresponding 15% damage bonus. Being classified only as a Specialist does not automatically qualify it.

- **Calculation**: On a Weakspot Hit, increase the additional Weakspot/Finesse Damage component. The whole damage amount is not multiplied by 1.25. Weapon, armour, attack type and whether the hit is Critical may change this component's share.

- **Damage example**: Assume a normal component of 100 and additional Weakspot component of 100, for 200 total. The bonus gives 100 + 100 × 1.25 = 225, a 12.5% increase in total damage.

- **Weapon difference example**: Another weapon with a normal component of 100 and additional component of 300 starts at 400. The bonus gives 100 + 300 × 1.25 = 475, a total increase of 18.75%. The same 25% Weakspot bonus therefore does not give every weapon the same total damage percentage increase.

### Long Lasting

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c19f893c-1a73-4111-b234-e675605b17b5" width="72" height="72" alt="Long Lasting talent icon">

- **Duration example**: A Stimm normally lasting 15 seconds lasts 15 + 5 = 20 seconds. This adds a fixed 5 seconds, not 5%.

- **Cooldown effect**: The Scum's dedicated Stimm pauses natural cooldown recovery while its effects are active. Extending those effects also delays the start of natural cooldown recovery.

- **Applicability**: Extends Stimms with a timed effect. Instant healing itself does not become five more seconds of healing.

### Blessed Stimms

- **Recovery**: After using a Stimm, each Kill while its effects remain clears Corruption equal to 1% of maximum Health. Corruption that has consumed an entire Health segment cannot be cleared.

- **Recovery example**: At maximum Health 200, each Kill clears at most 2. Clearing stops once the accumulated amount reaches 100. Using another Stimm resets the accumulated amount for that use.

- **Threshold exception**: Each Kill checks the 50% threshold before applying a full clear. If 99 has been cleared and this Kill clears 2, the total reaches 101 before stopping. The last clear can therefore slightly exceed the stated threshold.

### Hive City Brawler

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb31261-7422-451a-9aac-d1c38b48c802" width="72" height="72" alt="Hive City Brawler talent icon">

- **Calculation**: Damage Reduction = 20% × current Stamina fraction; Melee Damage bonus = 20% × spent Stamina fraction. Both adjust as Stamina changes.

- **Half-Stamina example**: At 50% Stamina remaining, both bonuses are 10%. Counting only this effect, incoming damage of 100 becomes 90, and Melee Damage of 100 becomes 110.

- **Full/empty-Stamina example**: At full Stamina, incoming damage is 100 × 0.8 = 80, with no Melee Damage bonus. At empty Stamina, there is no Damage Reduction and Melee Damage is 100 × 1.2 = 120.

- **Other bonuses**: Damage Reduction uses an independent damage-taken multiplier. With another independent 20% reduction at full Stamina, damage is 100 × 0.8 × 0.8 = 64. Melee Damage adds to other bonuses at the same stage.

### Pickpocket

- **Trigger**: Kill an Elite or Specialist with a Melee Attack while Ammo Reserve is below 20% of its maximum, then refill the reserve to that threshold. Ammunition in the clip is excluded from the threshold.

- **Refill example**: With maximum reserve 150, the threshold is ⌊150 × 20%⌋ = 30 rounds. At 8 rounds, gain 22 to reach 30; at 30, nothing triggers. With a maximum of 37, the rounded-down threshold is 7 rounds.

### Battering Momentum

- **Trigger**: Hitting the third enemy with the same Melee Attack grants 50% Damage Cleave and Stagger Cleave. It is consumed when the next attack starts hitting; reaching three enemies again can grant it again.

- **Cleave example**: Damage Cleave capacity 10 and Stagger Cleave capacity 8 become 10 × 1.5 = 15 and 8 × 1.5 = 12. Actual enemies hit still depend on enemy mass and weapon limits.

- **Duration limit**: There is no fixed countdown in seconds. Subsequent hits consume this effect; it does not continuously increase every attack's damage.

## Stimm recipes

Recipes share a 30-point budget. Their selected effects act together after using the dedicated Stimm; each recipe documents its cost, duration and stacking examples.

### Equip Cartel Special

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51c007e0-bed4-4759-a369-04ab37032369" width="72" height="72" alt="Equip Cartel Special talent icon">

- **Equipping**: Select at least one effect in the Stimm recipe tree to equip your dedicated Stimm. The central icon itself costs no points.

- **Recipes and effects**: Recipes share 30 points, with each recipe costing 1–5 points. On use, the selected recipes act together for 15 seconds; Long Lasting adds another 5 seconds.

- **Recovery time**: Recovery starts after the effects end. With total recipe cost P, base recovery seconds are `15 + 60 × (P − 1) ÷ 29`, rounded up. One point gives 15 seconds, 15 points gives 44 seconds, and 30 points gives 75 seconds.

- **Full-cycle example**: At a recipe cost of 30 points, ignoring other recovery effects, the injection acts for 15 seconds and then recovers for 75 seconds: 15 + 75 = 90 seconds before reuse.
